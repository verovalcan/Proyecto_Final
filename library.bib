abstract = {As historically abundant spongivores, hawksbill turtles Eretmochelys imbricata likely played a key ecological role on coral reefs. However, coral reefs are now experiencing global declines and many hawksbill populations are critically reduced. For endangered species, tracking movement has been recognized as fundamental to management. Since movements in marine vertebrates encompass three dimensions, evaluation of diving behavior and range is required to characterize marine turtle habitat. In this study, habitat use of hawksbill turtles on a Caribbean coral reef was elucidated by quantifying diel depth utilization and movements in relation to the boundaries of marine protected areas. Time depth recorders (TDRs) and ultrasonic tags were deployed on 21 Cayman Islands hawksbills, ranging in size from 26.4 to 58.4 cm straight carapace length. Study animals displayed pronounced diel patterns of diurnal activity and nocturnal resting, where diurnal dives were significantly shorter, deeper, and more active. Mean diurnal dive depth (±SD) was 8 ± 5 m, range 2-20 m, mean nocturnal dive depth was 5 ± 5 m, range 1-14 m, and maximum diurnal dive depth was 43 ± 27 m, range 7-91 m. Larger individuals performed significantly longer dives. Body mass was significantly correlated with mean dive depth for nocturnal but not diurnal dives. However, maximum diurnal dive depth was significantly correlated with body mass, suggesting partitioning of vertical habitat by size. Thus, variable dive capacity may reduce intraspecific competition and provide resistance to degradation in shallow habitats. Larger hawksbills may also represent important predators on deep reefs, creating a broad ecological footprint over a range of depths. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {* Temperature strongly regulates the distribution and fitness of ectotherms, and many studies have measured the temperature dependence of physiological performance in controlled laboratory settings. In contrast, little is known about how temperature influences ectotherm performance in the wild, so the ecological significance of physiological performance as measured in the laboratory is unclear. * Our aim was to measure the temperature dependence of performance in the wild for several species of fishes and to explore how temperatures that maximize performance in the wild (ToptE) are related to species biogeographies. * We gathered body activity and growth data from the wild for nine tropical and temperate fish species, and by fitting thermal performance curves to these data, compared ToptE to species-specific warm range boundary temperatures (the average temperature of the warmest month at equatorward range limits). To explore the degree to which trends in the wild reflect trends in physiological performance measured in the laboratory, we also compiled published data on the temperature dependence of aerobic metabolic scope in fishes and compared these to our wild fish data. * We found ToptE in the wild was strongly correlated with warm range boundary temperatures, and that the difference between these two temperatures (the ‘environmental heating tolerance') was smaller for more-tropical species. Comparison with laboratory data revealed that ToptE approaches warm boundary temperatures in the wild at the same rate that the optimal temperature for aerobic scope (ToptAS) approaches upper critical temperatures (upper Tcrit) for aerobic scope in the laboratory, meaning that environmental heating tolerances in wild fishes closely mirror physiological heating tolerance (i.e. upper Tcrit − ToptAS) in captive fishes. * Our comparison of field- and laboratory-derived data highlights the ecological significance of aerobic metabolic scope in fishes and suggests wild fish species tend to perform best near the highest temperatures encountered in their range while maintaining a safety margin from the deleterious effects of upper critical temperatures.},

abstract = {Mangrove plants play an important role in heavy metal maintenance in a mangrove ecosystem. To evaluate the characteristics of heavy metal con-tamination in the Futian mangrove forest, Shenzhen, China, eight heavy metals in mangrove sediments and plants were monitored, including essential elements such as Cu and Zn, and non-essential elements such as Cr, Ni, As, Cd, Pb and Hg. The results showed that the heavy metals exhibited the following scheme: Zn [ As [ Cu {\&} Cr [ Pb [ Ni [ Cd {\&} Hg in sed-iment cores, among which Cd, As, Pb and Hg contents were nearly ten times higher than the background values. There was no significant difference in metal maintenance capability between native and exotic species. In mangrove plants' leaves and stems, con-centrations of Cu, Zn and As were higher than other heavy metals. The low bioconcentration factors for most heavy metals, except for Cr, implied the limited ability of heavy metal accumulation by the plants. Mangrove plants seem to develop some degree of tolerance to Cr. The factor analysis implies that anthropogenic influences have altered metal mobility and bioavailability.},

abstract = {Mangrove forests are important carbon sinks in the tropics, yet tropical mangrove deforestation and land use
conversion still persists. Reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources
in wetlands are important in regional and national emissions inventories. However, very few studies have been
conducted to measure on the GHG fluxes in coastal wetlands, particularly in mangrove forest and non-forest land
uses in deforested mangroves. We investigated the soil fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O in mangrove forest and nonforest
land uses on deforested mangrove areas (i.e. abandoned aquaculture ponds, coconut plantations, abandoned
salt ponds, and cleared mangroves) in the coasts of Honda Bay, Philippines. Results showed that the
emissions of CO2 and CH4 were higher by 2.6 and 6.6 times in mangrove forests (110 and 0.6 kg CO2e ha −1 day −1
, respectively) while N2O emissions were lower by 34 times compared to the average of non-forest land uses
(1.3 kg CO2e ha −1 day −1
). CH4 and N2O emissions accounted for 0.59{\%} and 0.04{\%} of the total emissions in
mangrove forest as compared to 0.23{\%} and 3.07{\%} for non-forest land uses, respectively. Site-scale soil GHG flux
distribution could be mapped with 75{\%} to 83{\%} accuracy using Ordinary Kriging. Unlike mangroves that can
offset all GHG emissions through CO2 uptake from photosynthesis, the non-forest land uses cannot offset their
emissions on-site as they are usually devoid of vegetation. Our results could be utilised in higher tier national
GHG inventories, to refine regional and global estimates of GHG emissions in mangrove wetlands, and improve
policy on coastal wetlands conservation.},

abstract = { This study characterized fish species composition and assemblage structure of two adjacent macrotidal estuaries that had been altered by diking. From February to December 2004, monthly fish samples were collected from the Geum River and Mangyeong River estuaries using stow nets. Coastal migrant fish and brackish-water fish represented 95.5{\%} of species. Interestuary species composition similarity was relatively low between estuarine habitats (36.4{\%}). The proportion of brackish-water fish was significantly higher in the Mangyeong River estuary (MRE) than in the Geum River estuary (GRE). This result may reflect the variability in the fish community associated with diking, which may have affected fish migration pathways. In the GRE, the estuary dike might have limited the access of brackish-water fish to brackish water. In contrast, in the MRE, it appears that movement of coastal migrant fish toward brackish waters was restricted by diking the estuary. The present study provides useful information for safeguarding the sustainability of estuarine ecosystems.},

@article{Peck2004,
abstract = {1. Biological capacities to respond to changing environments dictate success or failure
of populations and species over time. The major environmental feature in this context
is often temperature, and organisms across the planet vary widely in their capacity to cope
with temperature variation. With very few exceptions, Antarctic marine species are more
sensitive to temperature variation than marine groups elsewhere, having survivable temperature
envelopes between 5 °C and 12 °C above the minimum sea temperature of −2 °C.
2. Our findings show that in biological functions important to long-term survival these
animals are even more tightly constrained. The Antarctic bivalve mollusc Laternula
elliptica and limpet Nacella concinna both survive a few days in experiments at 9–10 °C,
but suffer 50{\%} failure in essential biological activities at 2–3 °C and complete loss at
5 °C. The Antarctic scallop Adamussium colbecki is even more sensitive, and loses the
ability to swim as temperature approaches 2 °C.
3. These failures of activity are caused by a loss of aerobic capacity, and the animals
investigated are so sensitive that a 2 °C rise in sea temperature could cause population
or species removal from the Southern Ocean.},

In the major dry and major wet seasons, the photosynthetic rate and gross glucose production were two to five times lower in the completely diked sites compared to the partially diked and non-diked habitats. The average dry weights of branches, flowers and leaves did not differ significantly between sites. The same held true for propagules from the major dry and major wet season. However, propagules from the transition period collected in the non-diked and partially diked biotopes yielded appre-ciable amounts of dry matter, while plants in the completely diked forests did not carry any propagules. No statistically significant differences were found among nutrient content in the leaves of plants from the different habitats. Our results suggest black mangrove growing in diked habitats may suffer a certain degree of environmental stress, which may affect important biological processes, such as photosynthesis, gross glucose production, and propagule formation.},

@article{MoreiradosSantos2017,
abstract = {Although Brazil has defined mangroves as permanent preservation areas and banned the exploration of
any mangrove resources, wood is still explored by underprivileged coastal populations. Restrictions
regulating the use of mangrove wood are at odds with the social reality of many traditional or neotraditional
coastal populations that depend on this resource. The current social conflicts raised or
intensified by a restrictive federal legislation clearly point to the need of less controversial management
strategies. Knowledge of the present and past usage of mangrove resources is a necessary basis for the
development of more viable and reasonable conservation strategies. In this study, we defined the current
and past uses of mangrove wood in coastal villages of the subtropical Bay of Paranagua, in Southern 
Brazil. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with longtime residents or community leaders. The
main past uses were woodcutting for firewood and tannin extraction, sold or used for subsistence.
Current uses are mostly related to fishing activities and have been restricted to personal consumption.
The use of wood has declined in the last decades due to law restrictions, the increasing availability of new
energy sources and new materials for fishing such as nylon nets. We suggest that natural forest turnover,
combined with appropriate management actions, could allow for sustainable wood extraction in places
where populations are small and mangroves are extensive, as in this subtropical estuarine system. Even
though the current need for wood resources is not significant, the use of wood may help local residents
in their daily needs and improve their quality of life.},

abstract = {To ensure the success of reintroduction programs, it is important to monitor the postrelease behavior and survival of released animals. In this study, the post-release movement and behavior of 5 wild and 5 head-started hawksbill turtles Eretmochelys imbricata were monitored using ultrasonic telemetry. Their dispersal directions and recaptures may indicate that wild turtles perform homing migrations. However, the head-started turtles showed non-uniform patterns in dispersal movements. Four head-started turtles moved out of the monitoring area in various directions, whereas one turtle stayed within the monitoring area for approx. 10 mo. These results might indicate that head-started turtles wander aimlessly in their new surroundings. Signal reception patterns indicated that wild turtles were active in the daytime and rested under the coral at night. Although the head-started turtles also rest at night, their resting places did not seem to be sheltered from hazardous sea conditions or adequate for efficient resting. Therefore, head-started hawksbill turtles appear to need pre-release training such as exposure to structures or ledges in the rearing tank so they can utilize similar structures in the wild for shelter during rest periods and maximize their dive duration by employing these as a roof to counteract the positive buoyant effect of inhaled air. Prey analysis of a head-started turtle captured incidentally demonstrates that these turtles can make feeding adaptations to adjust to the natural environment. These findings provide constructive information for the implementation and improvement of head-start programs. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2010.},

abstract = {H I G H L I G H T S • The estuary acts as a source of atmospheric methane and nitrous oxide. • Anthropogenic inputs affect the distribution of the greenhouse gases. • Dissolved gases presented an important longitudinal gradient. • Seasonal variations highly depended on the precipitation regimen. a b s t r a c t Coastal areas are subject to a great anthropogenic pressure because more than half of the world's population lives in its vicinity causing organic matter inputs, which intensifies greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Dissolved concentrations of CH 4 and N 2 O have been measured seasonally during 2013 in the Guadalete River Es-tuary, which flows into the Cadiz Bay (southwestern Spanish coast). It has been intensely contaminated since 1970. Currently it receives wastewater effluents from cities and direct discharges from nearby agriculture crop. Eight sampling stations have been established along 18 km of the estuary. CH 4 and N 2 O were measured using a gas chromatograph connected to an equilibration system. Additional parameters such as organic matter, dis-solved oxygen, nutrients and chlorophyll were determinate as well, in order to understand the relationship be-tween physicochemical and biological processes. Gas concentrations increased from the River mouth toward the inner part, closer to the wastewater treatment plant discharge. Values varied widely within 21.8 and 3483.4 nM for CH 4 and between 9.7 and 147.6 nM for N 2 O. Greenhouse gas seasonal variations were large influ-enced by the precipitation regime, masking the temperature influence. The Guadatete Estuary acted as a green-house gas source along the year, with mean fluxes of 495.7 $\mu$mol m −2 d −1 and 92.8 $\mu$mol m −2 d −1 for CH 4 and N 2 O, respectively.},

They spawned 5?8 d after the full moon, with a peak on the sixth day, similar to colonies in Panama. The months of spawning were August and September in 1998, but July and August in 1999 and 2000. This temporal difference between the months of spawning corresponded to inter-annual variations in seawater temperature profiles. Initial gamete development each year occurred only when the daily mean seawater temperature during the month before spawning exceeded 27?C. There was a significant pos itive relationship between reproductive effort (gamete volume) of colonies and rising seawater temperature in the month preceding spawning; this was true for both the initial and the sec ond spawning months.

abstract = {Mangrove wetlands are one of the most important ecosystems on earth, providing habitats for both marine and terrestrial organisms as well as supporting essential human services. However, high dependence of humans on these sys-tems is leading to significant transformation of mangrove wet-lands and reduction in their ecosystem services including fish-eries. The objectives of this study were to estimate the biomass of two mangrove wetlands in Ghana within urban and rural contexts and determine the fish fauna assemblages as part of baseline setting. The study used the structural parameters of mangrove species and allometry to estimate the biomass of both forest systems. Fish community structure were deter-mined based on ecological surveys. The findings show that the standing biomass of the mangrove forests were sig-nificantly higher (p {\textless} 0.01) in the rural wetland (394.49 t/ha) compared to the urban wetland (126.29 t/ ha). Fish fauna assemblages, referring to species rich-ness and diversity were higher in the urban wetland at 4.21 and 2.64 respectively compared to the rural wet-land at 3.46 and 2.09 respectively. This paper concludes that a well-developed mangrove system with high mangrove biomass may not necessarily imply high fish species richness and diversity.},

abstract = {In the past decade, ecologists have witnessed vast improvements in our ability to collect animal movement data through animal-borne technology, such as through GPS or ARGOS systems. However, more data does not necessarily yield greater knowledge in understanding animal ecology and conservation. In this paper, we provide a review of the major benefits, problems and potential misuses of GPS/Argos technology to animal ecology and conservation. Benefits are obvious, and include the ability to collect fine-scale spatio-temporal location data on many previously impossible to study animals, such as ocean-going fish, migratory songbirds and long-distance migratory mammals. These benefits come with significant problems, however, imposed by frequent collar failures and high cost, which often results in weaker study design, reduced sample sizes and poorer statistical inference. In addition, we see the divorcing of biologists from a field-based understanding of animal ecology to be a growing problem. Despite these difficulties, GPS devices have provided significant benefits, particularly in the conservation and ecology of wide-ranging species. We conclude by offering suggestions for ecologists on which kinds of ecological questions would currently benefit the most from GPS/Argos technology, and where the technology has been potentially misused. Significant conceptual challenges remain, however, including the links between movement and behaviour, and movement and population dynamics. {\textcopyright}2010 The Royal Society.},

The Cayman Islands aggregation demonstrated a broad size distribution (20.5–62.6 cm straight carapace length), slow growth rate (3.0 6 0.9 cm/y), and multiple recaptures, suggesting long- term residence in some individuals. Demonstrated home range was small (mean distance from capture to recapture 545 6 514 m, range 2–2080 m) although an international tag return suggested a long-range developmental migration. Vertical features provided important habitat in Little Cayman, and larger turtles were generally captured in deeper waters. Behavior at sighting varied by habitat: resting, swimming, and feeding were observed in coral reef, reef wall, and hardbottom colonized by sponges and gorgonians, and resting was frequently observed in uncolonized hardbottom. Images obtained from underwater photographers show that hawksbills forage on sponges and occasionally on jellyfish. We observed an apparent commensal feeding relationship between hawksbills and 3 species of angelfish as well as aggressive interactions between hawksbills. We also documented causes of injury and mortality in the study area— including legal, illegal and incidental take, vessel collisions, hurricanes, and natural predation.},

Knowledge about their diet and habitat use can aid in developing conservation strategies and promoting population recovery in the region. Although considered a spongivore in the Caribbean, data from the EP region indicate that hawksbills consume a wide array of prey species, including angiosperms. We used two approaches to study the diet of hawksbills at Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica: oesophageal lavage and stable isotope ({\$}\delta{\$}13C, {\$}\delta{\$}15N) analysis of bulk skin tissue and blood plasma. Lavage samples collected from 41 turtles revealed macroalgae as the predominant diet item (Rw = 20.22), followed by sea snails and excavating worms. Stable isotope values for blood plasma from 44 turtles ranged from-23.0‰ to-15.7‰ for {\$}\delta{\$}13C and 6.9‰ to 10.4‰ for {\$}\delta{\$}15N, whereas values for skin tissue were-20.4‰ to-13.9‰ and 9.3‰ to 11.0‰ for {\$}\delta{\$}13C and {\$}\delta{\$}15N, respectively. We compared these isotope values with those of five potential prey groups (sponge, sea snail, excavating worm, mangrove, macroalgae) using a multisource stable isotope mixing model analysis in R (SIAR). Our results indicated that multiple prey resources are important for hawksbills in Golfo Dulce, where sea snails, sponges and excavating worms contributed up to 63{\%} of the assimilated diet per individual, and mangrove and macroalgae up to 50{\%}. These data show that hawksbills in Golfo Dulce, and perhaps the wider EP region, are omnivorous, underscoring the importance for considering alternative habitats, aside of coral reefs, for its management and restoration.},

abstract = {The thermal biology of sea turtles depends upon the heat transfer properties of their environment as well as the physical and physiological characteristics of the turtles. In water, heat loss predominates over heat gain but on land, lethal heat gain during the day is one factor that selects for nocturnal nesting activity. Small turtles, Lepidochelys sp. and Eretmochelys imbricata, can nest during the day, if exposed to wind, because they are less affected by solar radiation than larger species since they lose more heat via convection. Sea turtles employ both behavioral and physiological thermoregulation. Loggerheads, Caretta caretta, can raise body temperatures (Tb) 3.8 C above ocean temperatures by basking in water and green turtles, Chelonia mydas, can elevate Tb 5 C above ocean tem- peratures by basking on land. Large turtles are endothermic. Green turtles ex- hibit regional endothermy, with active tissues 8 C above ocean temperatures during vigorous swimming. Leatherback turtles, Dermochelys coriacea, have body temperatures as much as 18 C above an ambient water temperature of 7.5 C. Multichannel telemetry demonstrates that the internal temperatures of a resting leatherback are higher than carapace and ambient air temperatures indicating that heat is generated internally and not absorbed from the environment.},

abstract = {The processes that drive the ontogeny of migratory strategies in long-lived animals with slow maturation remain enigmatic. While some short-lived migrants are known or believed to repeat the same migratory patterns throughout their lives, little is known on the time required for immature long-lived migrants to progressively acquire adult-like migratory behaviours, or which aspects take longer to refine during the maturation process. Here, we studied the ontogeny of long-distance migratory strategies and related patterns of spatial distribution in a long-lived seabird species during the annual cycle. To do so, we deployed light-level geolocators on 4- to 9-year-old immature Cory's shearwaters (Calonectris borealis) and on breeding adults. We revealed that migratory timings and destinations of young shearwaters progressively changed with age. The effect of ageing was remarkably evident on spring migratory performance and phenology. Birds gradually shortened the duration of the non-breeding period by advancing departure date and reducing travelling time, which resulted in a sequential arrival at the colony of the various age contingents. Ageing immatures gradually changed from a more exploratory strategy to a more conservative way of exploiting resources, reducing both their year-round spatial spread across oceanic domains and the total distance travelled. Immatures always performed a trans-equatorial migration to the Southern Hemisphere, contrasting with 17{\%} of the adults which remained in the North Atlantic year-round. Finally, during the breeding season immatures were widely dispersed through the North Atlantic reducing their overlap with breeding adults. Our long-term study provides empirical support to the hypothesis that in long-lived species, the refinement of migratory behaviour and year-round spatial distribution is a progressive process mediated by age and experience, where life stage constraints and competition for resources may also play a role. The emerging pattern suggests that for some avian taxa, the ontogeny of migratory strategy is a prolonged, complex and dynamic process.},

abstract = {Movement is important to all organisms, and accordingly it is addressed in a huge number of papers in the literature. Of nearly 26,000 papers referring to movement, an estimated 34{\%} focused on movement by measuring it or testing hypotheses about it. This enormous amount of information is difficult to review and highlights the need to assess the collective completeness of movement studies and identify gaps. We surveyed 1,000 randomly selected papers from 496 journals and compared the facets of movement studied with a suggested framework for movement ecology, consisting of internal state (motivation, physiology), motion and navigation capacities, and external factors (both the physical environment and living organisms), and links among these components. Most studies simply measured and described the movement of organisms without reference to ecological or internal factors, and the most frequently studied part of the framework was the link between external factors and motion capacity. Few studies looked at the effects on movement of navigation capacity, or internal state, and those were mainly from vertebrates. For invertebrates and plants most studies were at the population level, whereas more vertebrate studies were conducted at the individual level. Consideration of only population-level averages promulgates neglect of between-individual variation in movement, potentially hindering the study of factors controlling movement. Terminology was found to be inconsistent among taxa and subdisciplines. The gaps identified in coverage of movement studies highlight research areas that should be addressed to fully understand the ecology of movement.},

@article{Carr1966,
abstract = {The present report is a summary and preliminary analysis of data on the green turtle, Chelonia mydas, that has been collected during a 22-year tagging program at Tortuguero, Costa Rica, 52 miles north of the Caribbean city of Puerto Limon. It is the first general account of Tortuguero results since 1960. From 1955 through the 1976 season, approximately 12,000 female green turtles have been tagged on the nesting beach. Of these, 2522 have been seen in subsequent years; 1412 of them as return migrants and 1110 on distant forage grounds or in migration. No turtle tagged at Tortuguero has ever been reported from any other nesting shore. The paper is concerned mainly with the migratory and behavioral ecology of the colony and with interseasonal changes in the nesting population. Results are presented in five sections, as follows: (1) Migratory geography and speed of travel: of 1110 long-distance, postseasonal recoveries of Tortuguero tags 957 have come from the Miskito Cays and adjacent parts of Miskito Bank off the Nicaraguan coast. Smaller numbers of recoveries cluster in Colombia, Panama, and Mexico. Analysis of monthly recovery frequencies in Nicaragua, and of periods of time elapsed between tagging and recapture, reinforce the assumption that Miskito Bank is a resident foraging range and not merely a travel station. Migratory travel speeds based on tag recoveries are compared with those recorded in the literature. (2)Nesting and renesting: The average number of nestings by a Tortuguero turtle during a season at the breeding shore is 2.8; the recorded maximum is seven, although eight probably occur occasionally. There is evidence that one-time nestings are a regular occurrence. The average renesting interval is 12.1 days. Remigrant turtles were found to nest more often than recruits. (3) Remigration: Of 1412 turtles that have returned to Tortuguero after previous appearances there, only six came back the following season. Interval percentages for the three predominant remigration periods are: two years, 21 percent; three years, 49 percent; four years, 18 percent. A unique contribution of the report is an extensive record of remigratory cycle-shifts, and tables showing composition of the nesting colonies of 1962-1972 with respect to past and future remigration-interval frequencies. (4) Reproductive homing: A distinction is made between philopatry, or regional return, and site fixity--the tendency to nest repeatedly on the same beach section within the home region. These two surely involve different cues; and the responses mediating open-sea orientation must be different from both. (5) Size of the West Caribbean population: A calculation of the number of sexually mature green turtles in the western Caribbean is made. An equation that takes into consideration the different proportions of two-, three-, and four-year remigratory periods is used to convert nesting arrivals into total female population. Since the latter varies from year to year, the average for the last six years is used in the calculation, and the resulting figure is doubled, on the assumption that there is a 1:1 sex ratio. The resulting total of mature green turtles in the population is 62,532. In the final section, the future outlook for the population is assessed and the need for further research in its shifting habitats, particularly the internesting habitat, is pointed out. The critical importance of developing an excluder device to keep sea turtles out of shrimp trawls is discussed"},

abstract = {In the South Atlantic Ocean, few data exist regarding the dispersal of young oceanic sea turtles. We characterized the movements of laboratory-reared yearling loggerhead turtles from Brazilian rookeries using novel telemetry techniques, testing for differences in dispersal during different periods of the sea turtle hatching season that correspond to seasonal changes in ocean currents. Oceanographic drifters deployed alongside satellite-tagged turtles allowed us to explore the mechanisms of dispersal (passive drift or active swimming). Early in the hatching season turtles transited south with strong southward currents. Late in the hatching season, when currents flowed in the opposite direction, turtles uniformly moved northwards across the Equator. However, the movement of individuals differed from what was predicted by surface currents alone. Swimming velocity inferred from track data and an ocean circulation model strongly suggest that turtles' swimming plays a role in maintaining their position within frontal zones seaward of the continental shelf. The long nesting season of adults and behaviour of posthatchlings exposes young turtles to seasonally varying ocean conditions that lead some individuals further into the South Atlantic and others into the Northern Hemisphere. Such migratory route diversity may ultimately buffer the population against environmental changes or anthropologic threats, fostering population resiliency.},

abstract = {Mediterranean populations of loggerhead Caretta caretta and green sea turtles Chelonia mydas are subject to several anthropogenic threats, with documented mortality from incidental capture in fishing gear. However, how such mortalities actually affect the populations is uncertain without an estimate of population size. We derived a theoretical demographic structure for each species in the Mediterranean, assuming a stationary age distribution in a stable population with constant proportions of turtles in each life stage, using distributions of age-specific vital rates. We incorporated uncertainty into the main vital rate parameters to identify a likely order of magnitude of turtle abundance in different life stages. Through this approach, we aim to (1) provide a rough estimate of all population stage classes, particularly the juvenile classes that are most subject to fisheries interactions, (2) provide an estimate of reproductive life span, (3) identify and review the key demographic parameters, and (4) identify the priority gaps in our information in need of further investigation. The range of population abundance estimates from the models constructed with uncertainty (95{\%} CI) was 0.81-3.38 million loggerheads and 0.26-2.21 million green turtles, Mediterranean-wide. When we calculated the potential biological removal for the segment of the population at risk of fisheries capture, our estimates were comparable to or lower than the estimated bycatch levels in fisheries. Although the model assumes a stable population and provides only a rough estimate of abundance, these results suggest that the current bycatch level should be regarded as unsustainable for Mediterranean turtle populations.},

Discrete-time hidden Markov models (HMMs) achieve considerable computational gains by focusing on observations that are regularly spaced in time, and for which the measurement error is negligible. These conditions are often met, in particular for data related to terrestrial animals, so that a likelihood-based HMM approach is feasible. We describe a number of extensions of HMMs for animal movement modeling, including more flexible state transition models and individual random effects (fitted in a non-Bayesian framework). In particular we consider so-called hidden semi-Markov models, which may substantially improve the goodness of fit and provide important insights into the behavioral state switching dynamics. To showcase the expediency of these methods, we consider an application of a hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model to multiple bison movement paths. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {The paradigm-changing opportunities of biologging sensors for ecological research, especially movement ecology, are vast, but the crucial questions of how best to match the most appropriate sensors and sensor combinations to specific biological questions and how to analyse complex biologging data, are mostly ignored. Here, we fill this gap by reviewing how to optimize the use of biologging techniques to answer questions in movement ecology and synthesize this into an Integrated Biologging Framework (IBF). We highlight that multisensor approaches are a new frontier in biologging, while identifying current limitations and avenues for future development in sensor technology. We focus on the importance of efficient data exploration, and more advanced multidimensional visualization methods, combined with appropriate archiving and sharing approaches, to tackle the big data issues presented by biologging. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities in matching the peculiarities of specific sensor data to the statistical models used, highlighting at the same time the large advances which will be required in the latter to properly analyse biologging data. Taking advantage of the biologging revolution will require a large improvement in the theoretical and mathematical foundations of movement ecology, to include the rich set of high-frequency multivariate data, which greatly expand the fundamentally limited and coarse data that could be collected using location-only technology such as GPS. Equally important will be the establishment of multidisciplinary collaborations to catalyse the opportunities offered by current and future biologging technology. If this is achieved, clear potential exists for developing a vastly improved mechanistic understanding of animal movements and their roles in ecological processes and for building realistic predictive models.},

abstract = {The advent of miniaturized biologging devices has provided ecologists with unprecedented opportunities to record animal movement across scales, and led to the collection of ever-increasing quantities of tracking data. In parallel, sophisticated tools have been developed to process, visualize and analyse tracking data; however, many of these tools have proliferated in isolation, making it challenging for users to select the most appropriate method for the question in hand. Indeed, within the r software alone, we listed 58 packages created to deal with tracking data or ‘tracking packages'. Here, we reviewed and described each tracking package based on a workflow centred around tracking data (i.e. spatio-temporal locations (x, y, t)), broken down into three stages: pre-processing, post-processing and analysis, the latter consisting of data visualization, track description, path reconstruction, behavioural pattern identification, space use characterization, trajectory simulation and others. Supporting documentation is key to render a package accessible for users. Based on a user survey, we reviewed the quality of packages' documentation and identified 11 packages with good or excellent documentation. Links between packages were assessed through a network graph analysis. Although a large group of packages showed some degree of connectivity (either depending on functions or suggesting the use of another tracking package), one third of the packages worked in isolation, reflecting a fragmentation in the r movement-ecology programming community. Finally, we provide recommendations for users when choosing packages, and for developers to maximize the usefulness of their contribution and strengthen the links within the programming community.},

abstract = {Variations in environmental parameters (e.g. temperature) that form part of global climate change have been associated with shifts in the timing of sea-sonal events for a broad range of organisms. Most studies evaluating such phenological shifts of individual taxa have focused on a limited number of locations, making it difficult to assess how such shifts vary regionally across a species range. Here, by using 1445 records of the date of first nesting for loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) at different breeding sites, on different continents and in different years across a broad latitudinal range (25 –398 0 N), we demonstrate that the gradient of the relationship between temperature and the date of first breeding is steeper at higher latitudes, i.e. the phenological responses to temperature appear strongest at the pole-ward range limit. These findings support the hypothesis that biological changes in response to climate change will be most acute at the poleward range limits and are in accordance with the predictions of MacArthur's hypothesis that poleward range limit for species range is environmentally limited. Our findings imply that the poleward populations of loggerheads are more sensitive to climate variations and thus they might display the impacts of climate change sooner and more prominently.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Pacific leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea populations have been declining precipitously. It has been suggested that fishery-associated mortality is the leading factor causing the decline; however, the sensitivity of leatherbacks to climate variability relative to their population ecology is unknown. 2. We investigated the effects of interannual climate variability, as governed by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), on leatherback nesting ecology. We used equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly data over various time scales derived from both moored buoys and remote satellites as signals of ENSO. We then incorporated these data into a remigration probability model for the largest nesting population of eastern Pacific leatherbacks at Parque Nacional Marino Las Baulas (PNMB), Costa Rica. 3. Our results showed that nesting females of PNMB exhibited a strong sensitivity to ENSO, as reflected in their nesting remigration probabilities. Cool La Nina events corresponded with a higher remigration probability and warm El Nino events corresponded with a lower remigration probability. 4. We suggest that productivity transitions at leatherback foraging areas in the eastern equatorial and south-eastern Pacific in response to El Nino/La Nina events result in variable remigration intervals and thus variable annual egg production. This phenomenon may render the eastern Pacific leatherback population more vulnerable to anthropogenic mortality than other populations. 5. Synthesis and applications. Physical indices of environmental variation can be used to estimate the probability of leatherbacks remigrating to nest at PNMB. This type of modelling approach can be extremely useful for understanding the effects of climatic variation on the population dynamics of sea turtles. Our remigration probability model can be applied to any monitored sea turtle nesting population where nesting site fidelity and beach monitoring coverage remains high. This modelling approach can help nesting beach monitoring programmes forecast remigrant numbers based on prior climate data, and can further quantify anthropogenic mortality by validating survival estimates.

As these recording devices become smaller and less expensive their use has increased.

We develop alternate visualisations of this data so as to analyse, explore and present new patterns of animal behaviour. Our visualisations include interactive spherical scatterplots, spherical histograms, clustering methods, and feature-based state diagrams of the data.

abstract = {GPS-tracking devices have been used in combination with a wide range of additional sensors to study animal behaviour, physiology and interaction with their environment. Tri-axial accelerometers allow researchers to remotely infer the behaviour of individuals, at all places and times. Collection of accelerometer data is relatively cheap in terms of energy usage, but the amount of raw data collected generally requires much storage space and is particularly demanding in terms of energy needed for data transmission. Here, we propose compressing the raw accelerometer (ACC) data into summary statistics within the tracking device (before transmission) to reduce data size, as a means to overcome limitations in storage and energy capacity. We explored this type of lossy data compression in the accelerometer data of tagged Bewick's swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii collected in spring 2017. Using software settings in which bouts of 2 s of both raw ACC data and summary statistics were collected in parallel but with different bout intervals to keep total data size comparable, we created the opportunity for a direct comparison of time budgets derived by the two data collection methods. We found that the data compression in our case yielded a six times reduction in data size per bout, and concurrent, similar decreases in storage and energy use of the device. We show that with the same accuracy of the behavioural classification, the freed memory and energy of the device can be used to increase the monitoring effort, resulting in a more detailed representation of the individuals' time budget. Rare and/or short behaviours, such as daily roost flights, were picked up significantly more when collecting summary statistics instead of raw ACC data (but note differences in sampling rate). Such level of detail can be of essential importance, for instance to make a reliable estimate of the energy budgets of individuals. In conclusion, we argue that this type of lossy data compression can be a well-considered choice in study situations where limitations in energy and storage space of the device pose a problem. Ultimately, these developments can allow for long-term and nearly continuous remote monitoring of the behaviour of free-ranging animals.},

abstract = {While little is known about hawksbill turtles Eretmochelys imbricata in the eastern Pacific Ocean, available information suggests that the population has declined substantially in recent decades and could be near extirpation in the region. To evaluate the current status of the population more effectively and to determine the feasibility of recovery efforts, a workshop of regional marine turtle specialists was held in June 2008 in Los Cbanos, El Salvador. An international working group, Iniciativa Carey del Pacfico Oriental (ICAPO; Eastern Pacific Hawksbill Initiative in English), was established to consolidate information, promote conservation projects and raise awareness about the species. We present information derived from the workshop and compiled by the ICAPO working group since that time. Considering only records from 1 January 2007 to 31 May 2009 it appears that El Salvador hosts the majority of known hawksbill turtle nesting activity in the eastern Pacific, with 79.6{\%} (n = 430) of all nesting observation records, and Mexico hosts the majority of records of hawksbill turtles at sea, with 60.3{\%} (n = 44) of all in-water observation records. Although current abundance is very low, the pervasiveness of the species in the region suggests potential for conservation and recovery. Despite a historical paucity of research focusing on this population, the relatively large and steadily increasing number of records as a result of concerted efforts demonstrates the viability of the ICAPO network as an instrument to promote conservation of this species in the eastern Pacific. {\textcopyright} 2010 Fauna {\&} Flora International.},

abstract = {Currently, the deployment of tracking devices is one of the most frequently used approaches to study movement ecology of birds. Recent miniaturization of light-level geolocators enabled studying small bird species whose migratory patterns were widely unknown. However, geolocators may reduce vital rates in tagged birds and may bias obtained movement data. There is a need for a thorough assessment of the potential tag effects on small birds, as previous meta-analyses did not evaluate unpublished data and impact of multiple life-history traits, focused mainly on large species and the number of published studies tagging small birds has increased substantially. We quantitatively reviewed 549 records extracted from 74 published and 48 unpublished studies on over 7,800 tagged and 17,800 control individuals to examine the effects of geolocator tagging on small bird species (body mass {\textless}100 g). We calculated the effect of tagging on apparent survival, condition, phenology and breeding performance and identified the most important predictors of the magnitude of effect sizes. Even though the effects were not statistically significant in phylogenetically controlled models, we found a weak negative impact of geolocators on apparent survival. The negative effect on apparent survival was stronger with increasing relative load of the device and with geolocators attached using elastic harnesses. Moreover, tagging effects were stronger in smaller species. In conclusion, we found a weak effect on apparent survival of tagged birds and managed to pinpoint key aspects and drivers of tagging effects. We provide recommendations for establishing matched control group for proper effect size assessment in future studies and outline various aspects of tagging that need further investigation. Finally, our results encourage further use of geolocators on small bird species but the ethical aspects and scientific benefits should always be considered.},

The purpose of this review is to compile the available information to improve our understanding of hurricane impacts and to promote the establishment of coastal landscape monitoring, because that is the best way to assess these impacts. Although generalizations on hurricane effects are elusive, some historical dynamics and temporal relationships are included and some details are presented on the impacts by resuspension and movement of sediments, storm waves, and breaking off of coral reef organisms. Some effects on marine turtles and coastal forests are also briefly pointed out.},

abstract = {Dispersal is a key mechanism enabling species to adjust their geographic range to rapid global change. However, dispersal is costly and environmental modifications are likely to modify the cost–benefit balance of individual dispersal decisions, for example, by decreasing functional connectivity. Dispersal costs occur during departure, transience and settlement, and are levied in terms of energy, risk, time and lost opportunity, potentially influencing individual fitness. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet quantified the energetic costs of dispersal across the dispersal period by comparing dispersing and philopatric individuals in the wild. Here, we employed animal-borne biologgers on a relatively large sample (N = 105) of juvenile roe deer to estimate energy expenditure indexed using the vector of dynamic body acceleration and mobility (distance travelled) in an intensively monitored population in the south-west of France. We predicted that energy expenditure would be higher in dispersers compared to philopatric individuals. We expected costs to be (a) particularly high during transience, (b) especially high in the more fragmented areas of the landscape and (c) concentrated during the night to avoid disturbance caused by human activity. There were no differences in energy expenditure between dispersers and philopatric individuals during the pre-dispersal phase. However, dispersers expended around 22{\%} more energy and travelled around 63{\%} further per day than philopatric individuals during transience. Differences in energy expenditure were much less pronounced during the settlement phase. The costs of transience were almost uniquely confined to the dawn period, when dispersers spent 23{\%} more energy and travelled 112{\%} further than philopatric individuals. Finally, the energetic costs of transience per unit time and the total distance travelled to locate a suitable settlement range were higher in areas of high road density. Our results provide strong support for the hypothesis that natal dispersal is energetically costly and indicate that transience is the most costly part of the process, particularly in fragmented landscapes. Further work is required to link dispersal costs with fitness components so as to understand the likely outcome of further environmental modifications on the evolution of dispersal behaviour.},

Discrete-time hidden Markov models (HMMs) achieve considerable computational gains by focusing on observations that are regularly spaced in time, and for which the measurement error is negligible. These conditions are often met, in particular for data related to terrestrial animals, so that a likelihood-based HMM approach is feasible. We describe a number of extensions of HMMs for animal movement modeling, including more flexible state transition models and individual random effects (fitted in a non-Bayesian framework). In particular we consider so-called hidden semi-Markov models, which may substantially improve the goodness of fit and provide important insights into the behavioral state switching dynamics. To showcase the expediency of these methods, we consider an application of a hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model to multiple bison movement paths. {\textcopyright}2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

@article{Bettaney2015,
abstract = {Background: With increasing interest in animal social networks, field biologists have started exploring the use of advanced tracking technologies for mapping social encounters in free-ranging subjects. Proximity logging, which involves the use of animal-borne tags with the capacity for two-way communication, has attracted particular attention in recent years. While the basic rationale of proximity logging is straightforward, systems generate very large datasets which pose considerable challenges in terms of processing and visualisation. Technical aspects of data handling are crucial for the success of proximity-logging studies, yet are only rarely reported in full detail. Here, we describe the procedures we employed for mining the data generated by a recent deployment of a novel proximity-logging system, "Encounternet", to study social-network dynamics in tool-using New Caledonian crows. Results: Our field deployment of an Encounternet system produced some 240,000 encounter logs for 33 crows over a 19-day study period. Using this dataset, we illustrate a range of procedures, including: examination of tag reciprocity (i.e. whether both tags participating in an encounter detected the encounter and, if so, whether their records differed); filtering of data according to a predetermined signal-strength criterion (to enable analyses that focus on encounters within a particular distance range); amalgamation of temporally clustered encounter logs (to remove data artefacts and to enable robust analysis of biological patterns); and visualisation of dynamic network data as timeline plots (which can be used, among other things, to visualise the simulated diffusion of information). Conclusions: Researchers wishing to study animal social networks with proximity-logging systems should be aware of the complexities involved. Successful data analysis requires not only a sound understanding of hardware and software operation, but also bioinformatics expertise. Our paper aims to facilitate future projects by explaining in detail some of the subtleties that are easily overlooked in first-pass analyses, but are key for reaching valid biological conclusions. We hope that this work will prove useful to other researchers, especially when read in conjunction with three recently published companion papers that report aspects of system calibration and key results.},

abstract = {A combination of climatic and environmental factors influences, and potentially guides, certain life-history processes, such as breeding. Sea turtle females may wait offshore for the optimal conditions to nest, but these environmental cues remain mostly unknown. Our aim was to identify climatic and tidal influences on nesting for leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) and try to find any specific conditions that induced them to abort the nesting attempt. To assess these issues, the beach in Pacuare Nature Reserve, on the Caribbean Costa Rica, was monitored from 2010 to 2015. Models showed that high atmospheric pressure and wind speed favoured nesting but high rainfall discouraged successful nesting; high and low tides were negatively correlated with nesting, suggesting that turtles avoid nesting when tidal cycles reach their extremes. Overall, climatic features likely related to storm episodes, and extreme tidal ranges, appear to influence leatherbacks' nesting behaviour. Therefore, the steady increase in intense storm occurrence predicted by climatic projections might represent an additional obstacle to the survival of this species.},

The largest coral reef development is found in the Gulf of Chiriqu{\'{i}}. Most coral reefs and coral communities are located on islands that are distant from the mainland runoff, and tidal exposure. Coral reef studies in the Panamanian Pacific have focused around two main topics:the reproductive ecology of coral species, and the ecological responses of coral communities to El Ni{\~{n}}o sea warming. The former study has shown that the coral reproductive activity is related to thermal regimes, and has resulted in five publications involving eight species in four genera. The latter is the most important natural disturbance influencing Pacific Panamanian reefs, and is treated with five other natural disturbances including upwelling, subaerial exposures, dinoflagellate blooms, terrestrial runoff, and Acanthaster planci, which play important roles in structuring coral reef communities in Panam{\'{a}}. In addition, there are four main anthropogenic stressors influencing Panamanian reefs: coral extraction, ship groundings, herbicides, and overfishing.

abstract = {The processes that drive the ontogeny of migratory strategies in long-lived animals with slow maturation remain enigmatic. While some short-lived migrants are known or believed to repeat the same migratory patterns throughout their lives, little is known on the time required for immature long-lived migrants to progressively acquire adult-like migratory behaviours, or which aspects take longer to refine during the maturation process. Here, we studied the ontogeny of long-distance migratory strategies and related patterns of spatial distribution in a long-lived seabird species during the annual cycle. To do so, we deployed light-level geolocators on 4- to 9-year-old immature Cory's shearwaters (Calonectris borealis) and on breeding adults. We revealed that migratory timings and destinations of young shearwaters progressively changed with age. The effect of ageing was remarkably evident on spring migratory performance and phenology. Birds gradually shortened the duration of the non-breeding period by advancing departure date and reducing travelling time, which resulted in a sequential arrival at the colony of the various age contingents. Ageing immatures gradually changed from a more exploratory strategy to a more conservative way of exploiting resources, reducing both their year-round spatial spread across oceanic domains and the total distance travelled. Immatures always performed a trans-equatorial migration to the Southern Hemisphere, contrasting with 17{\%} of the adults which remained in the North Atlantic year-round. Finally, during the breeding season immatures were widely dispersed through the North Atlantic reducing their overlap with breeding adults. Our long-term study provides empirical support to the hypothesis that in long-lived species, the refinement of migratory behaviour and year-round spatial distribution is a progressive process mediated by age and experience, where life stage constraints and competition for resources may also play a role. The emerging pattern suggests that for some avian taxa, the ontogeny of migratory strategy is a prolonged, complex and dynamic process.},

abstract = {GPS-tracking devices have been used in combination with a wide range of additional sensors to study animal behaviour, physiology and interaction with their environment. Tri-axial accelerometers allow researchers to remotely infer the behaviour of individuals, at all places and times. Collection of accelerometer data is relatively cheap in terms of energy usage, but the amount of raw data collected generally requires much storage space and is particularly demanding in terms of energy needed for data transmission. Here, we propose compressing the raw accelerometer (ACC) data into summary statistics within the tracking device (before transmission) to reduce data size, as a means to overcome limitations in storage and energy capacity. We explored this type of lossy data compression in the accelerometer data of tagged Bewick's swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii collected in spring 2017. Using software settings in which bouts of 2 s of both raw ACC data and summary statistics were collected in parallel but with different bout intervals to keep total data size comparable, we created the opportunity for a direct comparison of time budgets derived by the two data collection methods. We found that the data compression in our case yielded a six times reduction in data size per bout, and concurrent, similar decreases in storage and energy use of the device. We show that with the same accuracy of the behavioural classification, the freed memory and energy of the device can be used to increase the monitoring effort, resulting in a more detailed representation of the individuals' time budget. Rare and/or short behaviours, such as daily roost flights, were picked up significantly more when collecting summary statistics instead of raw ACC data (but note differences in sampling rate). Such level of detail can be of essential importance, for instance to make a reliable estimate of the energy budgets of individuals. In conclusion, we argue that this type of lossy data compression can be a well-considered choice in study situations where limitations in energy and storage space of the device pose a problem. Ultimately, these developments can allow for long-term and nearly continuous remote monitoring of the behaviour of free-ranging animals.},

abstract = {Leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) have declined dramatically in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EP) in recent decades. Traditionally, population assessments have relied on the numbers of turtles on the beaches with the highest abundance of turtles (index beaches) and often disregarded the importance of nesting beaches with smaller, but still regular, numbers of nesting turtles (secondary beaches). We characterize leatherback nesting on secondary beaches throughout Pacific Costa Rica. Nesting distribution was significantly reduced since the 1990s and it currently appears to be constricted to the Santa Elena and Nicoya peninsulas. Over the past five years, nesting abundance on secondary beaches was low, ranging between 0.4 ± 0.5 and 5.3 ± 1.5 females and 3.8 ± 5.2 and 22.8 ± 10.8 nests per beach and per year. There was some exchange of turtles between beaches. The exchange rate (percentage of females that nested at least once on a different beach) ranged between 7{\%} and 28{\%}. While Caletas still registers multiple clutches that are laid by 1-2 females in some years, it may no longer qualify as a secondary beach due to the infrequent nature of nesting events registered recently and the total absence of nests in some of those years. Although nesting abundance is relatively low at secondary beaches, they host at least {\~{}}25{\%} of total leatherback nesting abundance in Costa Rica. As the EP leatherback turtle declines, not only do the numbers of nesting turtles decrease but local extirpations are occurring on, previously categorized, secondary beaches. The critically low number of turtles at present may prevent recolonization of sites where they have been extirpated.},

abstract = {Hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) inhabiting the eastern Pacific Ocean are one of the world's most threatened marine turtle management units. Despite the fact that knowledge about the status of sea turtles at foraging grounds is a key element for developing the effective conservation strategies, comprehensive studies of hawksbills at foraging habitats in the eastern Pacific remain lacking. For many years anecdotal information indicated Coiba Island National Park in Panama as a potentially important hawksbill foraging ground, which led to the initiation of monitoring surveys in September 2014. Ongoing mark-recapture surveys to assess population status, generate demographic data and identify key foraging sites have been conducted every six months in the park since that time. To date, a total of six monitoring campaigns consisting of four days each have been conducted, leading to the capture and tagging of 186 hawksbills, 51 of which were recaptured at least once. The size range of captured individuals was 30.0 to 75.5 cm and largely comprised of juveniles. Somatic growth rates of individual hawksbills were highly variable, ranging from −0.78 to 7.1 cm year−1. To our knowledge, these are the first published growth rates for juvenile hawksbill turtles in the eastern Pacific Ocean. When these growth data are combined with information on hawksbill demography and distribution, our findings indicate Coiba Island National Park is one of the most important known foraging sites for hawksbill sea turtles in the eastern Pacific Ocean.},

abstract = {Accelerometry is growing in popularity for remotely measuring fish swimming metrics, but appropriate sampling frequencies for accurately measuring these metrics are not well studied. This research examined the influence of sampling frequency (1–25 Hz) with tri-axial accelerometer biologgers on estimates of overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), tail-beat frequency, swimming speed and metabolic rate of bonefish Albula vulpes in a swim-tunnel respirometer and free-swimming in a wetland mesocosm. In the swim tunnel, sampling frequencies of ≥ 5 Hz were sufficient to establish strong relationships between ODBA, swimming speed and metabolic rate. However, in free-swimming bonefish, estimates of metabolic rate were more variable below 10 Hz. Sampling frequencies should be at least twice the maximum tail-beat frequency to estimate this metric effectively, which is generally higher than those required to estimate ODBA, swimming speed and metabolic rate. While optimal sampling frequency probably varies among species due to tail-beat frequency and swimming style, this study provides a reference point with a medium body-sized sub-carangiform teleost fish, enabling researchers to measure these metrics effectively and maximize study duration.},

abstract = {Background: Accelerometers are powerful sensors in many bio-logging devices, and are increasingly allowing researchers to investigate the performance, behaviour, energy expenditure and even state, of free-living animals. Another sensor commonly used in animal-attached loggers is the magnetometer, which has been primarily used in dead-reckoning or inertial measurement tags, but little outside that. We examine the potential of magnetometers for helping elucidate the behaviour of animals in a manner analogous to, but very different from, accelerometers. The particular responses of magnetometers to movement means that there are instances when they can resolve behaviours that are not easily perceived using accelerometers. Methods: We calibrated the tri-axial magnetometer to rotations in each axis of movement and constructed 3- dimensional plots to inspect these stylised movements. Using the tri-axial data of Daily Diary tags, attached to individuals of number of animal species as they perform different behaviours, we used these 3-d plots to develop a framework with which tri-axial magnetometry data can be examined and introduce metrics that should help quantify movement and behaviour. Results: Tri-axial magnetometry data reveal patterns in movement at various scales of rotation that are not always evident in acceleration data. Some of these patterns may be obscure until visualised in 3D space as tri-axial spherical plots (m-spheres). A tag-fitted animal that rotates in heading while adopting a constant body attitude produces a ring of data around the pole of the m-sphere that we define as its Normal Operational Plane (NOP). Data that do not lie on this ring are created by postural rotations of the animal as it pitches and/or rolls. Consequently, stereotyped behaviours appear as specific trajectories on the sphere (m-prints), reflecting conserved sequences of postural changes (and/or angular velocities), which result from the precise relationship between body attitude and heading. This novel approach shows promise for helping researchers to identify and quantify behaviours in terms of animal body posture, including heading. Conclusion: Magnetometer-based techniques and metrics can enhance our capacity to identify and examine animal behaviour, either as a technique used alone, or one that is complementary to tri-axial accelerometry.},

abstract = {Currently, the deployment of tracking devices is one of the most frequently used approaches to study movement ecology of birds. Recent miniaturization of light-level geolocators enabled studying small bird species whose migratory patterns were widely unknown. However, geolocators may reduce vital rates in tagged birds and may bias obtained movement data. There is a need for a thorough assessment of the potential tag effects on small birds, as previous meta-analyses did not evaluate unpublished data and impact of multiple life-history traits, focused mainly on large species and the number of published studies tagging small birds has increased substantially. We quantitatively reviewed 549 records extracted from 74 published and 48 unpublished studies on over 7,800 tagged and 17,800 control individuals to examine the effects of geolocator tagging on small bird species (body mass {\textless}100 g). We calculated the effect of tagging on apparent survival, condition, phenology and breeding performance and identified the most important predictors of the magnitude of effect sizes. Even though the effects were not statistically significant in phylogenetically controlled models, we found a weak negative impact of geolocators on apparent survival. The negative effect on apparent survival was stronger with increasing relative load of the device and with geolocators attached using elastic harnesses. Moreover, tagging effects were stronger in smaller species. In conclusion, we found a weak effect on apparent survival of tagged birds and managed to pinpoint key aspects and drivers of tagging effects. We provide recommendations for establishing matched control group for proper effect size assessment in future studies and outline various aspects of tagging that need further investigation. Finally, our results encourage further use of geolocators on small bird species but the ethical aspects and scientific benefits should always be considered.},

abstract = {Ecological niche theory predicts sympatric species to show segregation in their spatio-temporal habitat utilization or diet as a strategy to avoid competition. Similarly, within species individuals may specialize on specific dietary resources or foraging habitats. Such individual specialization seems to occur particularly in environments with predictable resource distribution and limited environmental variability. Still, little is known about how seasonal environmental variability affects segregation of resources within species and between closely related sympatric species. The aim of the study was to investigate the foraging behaviour of three closely related and sympatrically breeding fulmarine petrels (Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica, cape petrels Daption capense and southern fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides) in a seasonally highly variable environment (Prydz Bay, Antarctica) with the aim of assessing inter- and intraspecific overlap in utilized habitat, timing of foraging and diet and to identify foraging habitat preferences. We used GPS loggers with wet/dry sensors to assess spatial habitat utilization over the entire breeding season. Trophic overlap was investigated using stable isotope analysis based on blood, feathers and egg membranes. Foraging locations were identified using wet/dry data recorded by the GPS loggers and expectation-maximization binary clustering. Foraging habitat preferences were modelled using generalized additive models and model cross-validation. During incubation and chick-rearing, the utilization distribution of all three species overlapped significantly and species also overlapped in the timing of foraging during the day—partly during incubation and completely during chick-rearing. Isotopic centroids showed no significant segregation between at least two species for feathers and egg membranes, and among all species during incubation (reflected by blood). Within species, there was no individual specialization in foraging sites or environmental space. Furthermore, no single environmental covariate predicted foraging activity along trip trajectories. Instead, best-explanatory environmental covariates varied within and between individuals even across short temporal scales, reflecting a highly generalist behaviour of birds. Our results may be explained by optimal foraging theory. In the highly productive but spatio-temporally variable Antarctic environment, being a generalist may be key to finding mobile prey—even though this increases the potential for competition within and among sympatric species.},

abstract = {Top pelagic predators such as tunas, sharks, marine turtles and mammals have historically been difficult to study due to their large body size and vast range over the oceanic habitat. In recent years the development of small microprocessor-based data storage tags that are surgically implanted or satellite-linked provide marine researchers a novel avenue for examining the movements, physiology and behaviors of pelagic animals in the wild. When biological and physical data obtained from the tags are combined with satellite derived sea surface temperature and ocean color data, the relationships between the movements, behaviors and physical ocean environment can be examined. Tag-bearing marine animals can function as autonomous ocean profilers providing oceanographic data wherever their long migrations take them. The biologging science is providing ecological physiologists with new insights into the seasonal movements, habitat utilization, breeding behaviors and population structures in of marine vertebrates. In addition, the data are revealing migration corridors, hot spots and physical oceanographic patterns that are key to understanding how organisms such as bluefin tunas use the open ocean environment. In the 21st century as ecosystem degradation and global warming continue to threaten the existence of species on Earth, the field of physiological ecology will play a more pivotal role in conservation biology.},

Interannual variation was greatest in the green turtle. When comparing green and loggerhead turtles nesting in Cyprus we found that green turtles were more likely to change the interval between laying seasons and showed greater variation in the number of clutches laid in a season. We suggest that these di¡erences are driven by the varying trophic statuses of the different species. Green turtles are herbivorous, feeding on sea grasses and macro-algae, and this primary production will be more tightly coupled with prevailing environmental conditions than the carnivorous diet of the loggerhead turtle.},

abstract = {The failures of traditional target-species management have led many to propose an ecosystem approach to fisheries to promote sustainability. The ecosystem approach is necessary, especially to account for fishery-ecosystem interactions, but by itself is not sufficient to address two important factors contributing to unsustainable fisheries: inappropriate incentives bearing on fishers and the ineffective governance that frequently exists in commercial, developed fisheries managed primarily by total-harvest limits and input controls. We contend that much greater emphasis must be placed on fisher motivation when managing fisheries. Using evidence from more than a dozen natural experiments in commercial fisheries, we argue that incentive-based approaches that better specify community and individual harvest or territorial rights and price ecosystem services and that are coupled with public research, monitoring, and effective oversight promote sustainable fisheries. {\textcopyright} 2006 NRC.},

abstract = {A goal of animal movement analysis is to reveal behavioural mechanisms by which organisms utilize complex and variable environments. Statistical analysis of movement data is complicated by the fact that the data are multidimensional, autocorrelated and often marked by error and irregular measurement intervals or gappiness. Furthermore, movement data reflect behaviours that are themselves heterogeneous. Here, we model movement data as a subsampling of a continuous stochastic processes, and introduce the behavioural change point analysis (BCPA), a likelihood-based method that allows for the identification of significant structural changes. The BCPA is robust to gappiness and measurement error, computationally efficient, easy to implement and reveals structure that is otherwise difficult to discern. We apply the analysis to a GPS movement track of a northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), revealing an unexpectedly complex diurnal behavioural profile, and demonstrate its robustness to the greater errors associated with the ARGOS tracking system. By informing empirical interpretation of movement data, we suggest that the BCPA can eventually motivate the development of mechanistic behavioural models. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing LtdCNRS.},

abstract = {Recent increases in global temperatures have affected the phenology and survival of many species of plants and animals. We investigated a case study of the effects of potential climate change on a thermally sensitive species, the loggerhead sea turtle, at a breeding location at the northerly extent of the range of regular nesting in the United States. In addition to the physical limits imposed by temperature on this ectothermic species, sea turtle primary sex ratio is determined by the temperature experienced by eggs during the middle third of incubation. We recorded sand temperatures and used historical air temperatures (ATs) at Bald Head Island, NC, to examine past and predict future sex ratios under scenarios of warming. There were no significant temporal trends in primary sex ratio evident in recent years and estimated mean annual sex ratio was 58{\%} female. Similarly, there were no temporal trends in phenology but earlier nesting and longer nesting seasons were correlated with warmer sea surface temperature. We modelled the effects of incremental increases in mean AT of up to 7.5 1C, the maximum predicted increase under modelled scenarios, which would lead to 100{\%} female hatchling production and lethally high incubation temperatures, causing reduction in hatchling production. Populations of turtles in more southern parts of the United States are currently highly female biased and are likely to become ultra-biased with as little as 1 1C of warming and experience extreme levels of mortality if warming exceeds 3 1C. The lack of a demonstrable increase in AT in North Carolina in recent decades coupled with primary sex ratios that are not highly biased means that the male offspring from North Carolina could play an increasingly important role in the future viability of the loggerhead turtle in the Western Atlantic.},

abstract = {Integrating biomechanics, behavior and ecology requires a mechanistic understanding of the processes producing the movement of animals. This calls for contemporaneous biomechanical, behavioral and environmental data along movement pathways. A recently formulated unifying movement ecology paradigm facilitates the integration of existing biomechanics, optimality, cognitive and random paradigms for studying movement. We focus on the use of tri-axial acceleration (ACC) data to identify behavioral modes of GPS-tracked free-ranging wild animals and demonstrate its application to study the movements of griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus, Hablizl 1783). In particular, we explore a selection of nonlinear and decision tree methods that include support vector machines, classification and regression trees, random forest methods and artificial neural networks and compare them with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a baseline for classifying behavioral modes. Using a dataset of 1035 groundtruthed ACC segments, we found that all methods can accurately classify behavior (80–90{\%}) and, as expected, all nonlinear methods outperformed LDA. We also illustrate how ACC-identified behavioral modes provide the means to examine how vulture flight is affected by environmental factors, hence facilitating the integration of behavioral, biomechanical and ecological data. Our analysis of just over three-quarters of a million GPS and ACC measurements obtained from 43 free-ranging vultures across 9783 vulture-days suggests that their annual breeding schedule might be selected primarily in response to seasonal conditions favoring rising-air columns (thermals) and that rare long-range forays of up to 1750km from the home range are performed despite potentially heavy energetic costs and a low rate of food intake, presumably to explore new breeding, social and long-term resource location opportunities.},

abstract = {Elucidating spatio-temporal movements of animals is an integral component of wildlife conservation and protected species management. Between 2008 and 2010 we satellite tracked 15 adult female hawksbill turtles Eretmochelys imbricata in the eastern Pacific Ocean to evaluate their movement behavior and to guide management and conservation efforts of this highly endangered population. Movements and habitat use were highly neritic, and post-nesting migration distances (maximum = 283.11 km) were short relative to migrations of other sea turtle species. In foraging areas, the majority of hawksbills established restricted, inshore home ranges within mangrove estuaries. A large proportion ({\textgreater}65{\%}) of turtle location points fell within protected areas, although many of these sites lack enforcement and monitoring. The consistent use of estuar-ine and mangrove habitat for nesting and foraging may explain why hawksbills went virtually undetected in the eastern Pacific for decades. The spatially restricted and neritic life cycles of adult hawksbills in the eastern Pacific highlight threats (e.g. overlap with coastal fisheries, increased susceptibility to habitat degradation and/or catastrophic events) and opportunities for conservation (e.g. acute conservation target areas, less variant jurisdictional boundaries/regulations) for this species. Our results underscore the importance of strengthening protected area management, mangrove estuary protection and hawksbill research and conservation in the eastern Pacific. {\textcopyright}Inter-Research 2012.},

We standardized Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) as turtles caught per 100m of headrope length per one-hour soak time, which ranged from 0.06 at Punta Pargos to 0.58 in Bah{\'{i}}a Matapalito for hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), and from 0.01 in Punta Coyote to 0.10 in Cabo Blanco for Eastern Pacific green turtles (Chelonia mydas). We found site-specific size ranges for E. imbricata with mean ± Standard Deviation (SD) Curve Carapace Lengths (CCL) of 42.46±17.55cm in Bah{\'{i}}a Matapalito and 61.25±13.08cm in Cabo Blanco. Only one individual was found at each of the other sites with CCLs from 49.6cm to 60.5cm. Green turtles were found at three of the surveyed locations with mean CCLs of 67.67±19.44cm at Cabo Blanco and 69.40±9.40cm at Punta Coyote and only one individual at Bah{\'{i}}a Matapalito with a CCL of 56.2cm. The absence of adult size classes for E. imbricata and of small juvenile size classes for C. mydas at most of these sites stresses the complexity of species-specific distribution during different life stages in the Eastern Pacific and the urgent need to implement long-term monitoring at different coastal sites along the North Pacific to understand habitat connectivity. This study reveals the existence of fragile, non-protected foraging grounds for hawksbill and green turtles in Costa Rica's North Pacific, and serves as a guide for future research initiatives to strengthen national and regional conservation strategies.},

abstract = {The Gulf of Papagayo at the northern Pacific coast of Costa Rica experiences pronounced seasonal changes in water parameters caused by wind-driven coastal upwelling. While remote sensing and open water sampling already described the physical nature of this upwelling, the spatial and temporal effects on key parameters and processes in the water column have not been investigated yet, although being highly relevant for coral reef functioning. The present study investigated a range of water parameters on two coral reefs with different exposure to upwelling (Matapalo and Bajo Rojo) in a weekly to monthly resolution over one year (May 2013 to April 2014). Based on air temperature, wind speed and water temperature, three time clusters were defined: a) May to November 2013 without upwelling, b) December 2013 to April 2014 with moderate upwelling, punctuated by c) extreme upwelling events in February, March and April 2014. During upwelling peaks, water temperatures decreased by 7°C (Matapalo) and 9°C (Bajo Rojo) to minima of 20.1 and 15.3°C respectively, while phosphate, ammonia and nitrate concentrations increased 3 to 15-fold to maxima of 1.3 {\$}\mu{\$}mol PO43- L-1, 3.0 {\$}\mu{\$}mol NH4+ L-1 and 9.7 {\$}\mu{\$}mol NO3-L-1. This increased availability of nutrients triggered several successive phytoplankton blooms as indicated by 3-(Matapalo) and 6-fold (Bajo Rojo) increases in chlorophyll a concentrations. Particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (POC and PON) increased by 40 and 70{\%} respectively from February to April 2014. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased by 70{\%} in December and stayed elevated for at least 4 months, indicating high organic matter release by primary producers. Such strong cascading effects of upwelling on organic matter dynamics on coral reefs have not been reported previously, although likely impacting many reefs in comparable upwelling systems.},

The Southern section of the Caribbean coast has fringing and patch reefs, carbonate banks, and an incipient algal ridge. The Pacific coast has coral communities, reefs and isolated coral colonies. Coral reefs have been seriously impacted in the last 30 years, mainly by sediments (Caribbean coast and some Pacific reefs) and by El Ni{\~{n}}o warming events (both coasts). Monitoring is being carried out at three sites on each coast. Both coasts suffered significant reductions in live coral cover in the 1980's, but coral cover is now increasing in most sites. The government of Costa Rica is aware of the importance of coral reefs and marine environments in general, and in recent years decrees have been implemented (or are in the process of approval) to protect them, but limited resources endanger their proper management and conservation, including proper outreach to reef users and the general public.},

abstract = {Electronic tags (both biotelemetry and biologging platforms) have informed conservation and resource management policy and practice by providing vital information on the spatial ecology of animals and their environments. However, the extent of the contribution of biological sensors (within electronic tags) that measure an animal's state (e.g., heart rate, body temperature, and details of locomotion and energetics) is less clear. A literature review revealed that, despite a growing number of commercially available state sensor tags and enormous application potential for such devices in animal biology, there are relatively few examples of their application to conservation. Existing applications fell under 4 main themes: quantifying disturbance (e.g., ecotourism, vehicular and aircraft traffic), examining the effects of environmental change (e.g., climate change), understanding the consequences of habitat use and selection, and estimating energy expenditure. We also identified several other ways in which sensor tags could benefit conservation, such as determining the potential efficacy of management interventions. With increasing sensor diversity of commercially available platforms, less invasive attachment techniques, smaller device sizes, and more researchers embracing such technology, we suggest that biological sensor tags be considered a part of the necessary toolbox for conservation. This approach can measure (in real time) the state of free-ranging animals and thus provide managers with objective, timely, relevant, and accurate data to inform policy and decision making.},

abstract = {Popular frameworks for studying habitat selection include resource-selection functions (RSFs) and step-selection functions (SSFs), estimated using logistic and conditional logistic regression, respectively. Both frameworks compare environmental covariates associated with locations animals visit with environmental covariates at a set of locations assumed available to the animals. Conceptually, slopes that vary by individual, that is, random coefficient models, could be used to accommodate inter-individual heterogeneity with either approach. While fitting such models for RSFs is possible with standard software for generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs), straightforward and efficient one-step procedures for fitting SSFs with random coefficients are currently lacking. To close this gap, we take advantage of the fact that the conditional logistic regression model (i.e. the SSF) is likelihood-equivalent to a Poisson model with stratum-specific fixed intercepts. By interpreting the intercepts as a random effect with a large (fixed) variance, inference for random-slope models becomes feasible with standard Bayesian techniques, or with frequentist methods that allow one to fix the variance of a random effect. We compare this approach to other commonly applied alternatives, including models without random slopes and mixed conditional regression models fit using a two-step algorithm. Using data from mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) and Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra), we illustrate that our models lead to valid and feasible inference. In addition, we conduct a simulation study to compare different estimation approaches for SSFs and to demonstrate the importance of including individual-specific slopes when estimating individual- and population-level habitat-selection parameters. By providing coded examples using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) and Template Model Builder (TMB) for Bayesian and frequentist analysis via the R packages R-INLA and glmmTMB, we hope to make efficient estimation of RSFs and SSFs with random effects accessible to anyone in the field. SSFs with individual-specific coefficients are particularly attractive since they can provide insights into movement and habitat-selection processes at fine-spatial and temporal scales, but these models had previously been very challenging to fit.},

abstract = {Movement is important to all organisms, and accordingly it is addressed in a huge number of papers in the literature. Of nearly 26,000 papers referring to movement, an estimated 34{\%} focused on movement by measuring it or testing hypotheses about it. This enormous amount of information is difficult to review and highlights the need to assess the collective completeness of movement studies and identify gaps. We surveyed 1,000 randomly selected papers from 496 journals and compared the facets of movement studied with a suggested framework for movement ecology, consisting of internal state (motivation, physiology), motion and navigation capacities, and external factors (both the physical environment and living organisms), and links among these components. Most studies simply measured and described the movement of organisms without reference to ecological or internal factors, and the most frequently studied part of the framework was the link between external factors and motion capacity. Few studies looked at the effects on movement of navigation capacity, or internal state, and those were mainly from vertebrates. For invertebrates and plants most studies were at the population level, whereas more vertebrate studies were conducted at the individual level. Consideration of only population-level averages promulgates neglect of between-individual variation in movement, potentially hindering the study of factors controlling movement. Terminology was found to be inconsistent among taxa and subdisciplines. The gaps identified in coverage of movement studies highlight research areas that should be addressed to fully understand the ecology of movement.},

abstract = {Passive acoustic telemetry provides an important tool to study the spatial ecology and behaviour of organisms in marine and freshwater systems, but understanding the detection range of acoustic receivers is critical for interpreting acoustic data and establishing receiver spacing to maximize study efficiency. This study presents a comprehensive review of how acoustic detection range has been considered and assessed to date, summarizes important variables to monitor when determining the detection range of a receiver array, and provides recommendations to account for detection range during experimental design, analysis and data interpretation. A total of 378 passive acoustic telemetry studies (1986-2012) were scored against a set of pre-defined criteria to provide a standardized assessment of how well detection range was accounted for, from a maximum possible score of 45. Scores ranged from 0 to 39 (11.1 ± 0.4; mean ± 1 SE). Over the past decade mean scores have been consistently between 6.7 and 12.9 which indicates that detection range has not been adequately considered in most contemporary acoustic telemetry studies. Given the highly variable nature of detection range over space and time, it is necessary to create a culture of detection range testing among the scientific community. For robust telemetry studies it is recommended that consideration of detection range should be given a greater focus within study design, execution and data analysis. To aid array design in new systems, short-term detection range tests should be conducted in the most representative area of the study system prior to deployment. As well, fixed distance sentinel tags should ideally be deployed at a representative receiver site within the array to provide a continuous assessment of detection range and influential environmental parameters should be monitored to facilitate modeling of detection range variability over time. When warranted, data analysis should incorporate modeled variation in detection ranges. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {It is fundamentally important for many animal ecologists to quantify the costs of animal activities, although it is not straightforward to do so. The recording of triaxial acceleration by animal-attached devices has been proposed as a way forward for this, with the specific suggestion that dynamic body acceleration (DBA) be used as a proxy for movement-based power. Dynamic body acceleration has now been validated frequently, both in the laboratory and in the field, although the literature still shows that some aspects of DBA theory and practice are misunderstood. Here, we examine the theory behind DBA and employ modelling approaches to assess factors that affect the link between DBA and energy expenditure, from the deployment of the tag, through to the calibration of DBA with energy use in laboratory and field settings. Using data from a range of species and movement modes, we illustrate that vectorial and additive DBA metrics are proportional to each other. Either can be used as a proxy for energy and summed to estimate total energy expended over a given period, or divided by time to give a proxy for movement-related metabolic power. Nonetheless, we highlight how the ability of DBA to predict metabolic rate declines as the contribution of non-movement-related factors, such as heat production, increases. Overall, DBA seems to be a substantive proxy for movement-based power but consideration of other movement-related metrics, such as the static body acceleration and the rate of change of body pitch and roll, may enable researchers to refine movement-based metabolic costs, particularly in animals where movement is not characterized by marked changes in body acceleration.},

abstract = {An animal's behaviour is a response to its environment and physiological condition, and as such, gives vital clues as to its well-being, which is highly relevant in conservation issues. Behaviour can generally be typified by body motion and body posture, parameters that are both measurable using animal-attached accelerometers. Interpretation of acceleration data, however, can be complex, as the static (indicative of posture) and dynamic (motion) components are derived from the total acceleration values, which should ideally be recorded in all 3-dimensional axes. The principles of triaxial accelerometry are summarised and discussed in terms of the commonalities that arise in patterns of acceleration across species that vary in body pattern, life-history strategy, and the medium they inhabit. Using tri-axial acceleration data from deployments on captive and free-living animals (n = 12 species), behaviours were identified that varied in complexity, from the rhythmic patterns of locomotion, to feeding, and more variable patterns including those relating to social interactions. These data can be combined with positional information to qualify patterns of area-use and map the distribution of target behaviours. The range and distribution of behaviour may also provide insight into the transmission of disease. In this way, the measurement of tri-axial acceleration can provide insight into individual and population level processes, which may ultimately influence the effectiveness of conservation practice.},

abstract = {Marine ecosystems and the services they provide contribute greatly to human well-being but are becoming degraded in many areas around the world. The expansion of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) has been advanced as a potential solution to this problem but their economic feasibility has hardly been studied. We conduct an economic assessment of the costs and benefits of six scenarios for the global expansion of MPAs. The analysis is conducted at a high spatial resolution, allowing the estimated costs and benefits to reflect the ecological and economic characteristics and context of each MPA and marine ecosystem. The results show that the global benefits of expanding MPAs exceed their costs by a factor 1.4–2.7 depending on the location and extent of MPA expansion. Targeting protection towards pristine areas with high biodiversity yields higher net returns than focusing on areas with low biodiversity or areas that have experienced high human impact.},

abstract = {Coastal upwelling areas along eastern boundary currents have been recognized for having high planktonic production. In the Humboldt Current System off South America, little is known about the reproductive strategies of mesopelagic fishes and their utilization of highly productive coastal upwelling areas for spawning and early development. In the present study, we first document the spawning and nursery area of the highly abundant mesopelagic fish Maurolicus parvipinnis in the coastal upwelling zone off Talcahuano, central Chile. Second, we propose a mechanism by which ontogenetic and diel changes in vertical distribution of the early life history stages and the utilization of the local hydrodynamics facilitates the development of the larvae of this species over the shelf and nearby slope in a highly productive environment. Our results show that M. parvipinnis spawn during early spring at mid-depth in zones of intense upwelling. Larvae hatch mostly in the spawning area located on the southern edge of the slope, and are then advected northwards along the slope or over the shelf where high larval food concentrations occur. Over the shelf, larger larvae tend to vertically migrate, spending part of the night hours in the shallower layer where the water temperature is higher, and where food is most abundant. During the day, they remain at depth where offshore transport may be decreased. Those larvae that are not retained over the shelf are advected offshore, probably in the surface Ekman layer or in association with cold filaments that usually develop off the central zone along the shelf off Talcahuano. Although information on the spawning strategy of other Maurolicus species worldwide is sparse, there are some similarities in relation to the subsurface spawning, the larval presence in nearshore waters, and the early spring spawning season in association with periods of increased food availability. The spawning strategy described herein, therefore, may be a more common feature than previously believed for Maurolicus species, especially along coastal upwelling areas in eastern boundary currents.},

abstract = {An animal's behaviour is a response to its environment and physiological condition, and as such, gives vital clues as to its well-being, which is highly relevant in conservation issues. Behaviour can generally be typified by body motion and body posture, parameters that are both measurable using animal-attached accelerometers. Interpretation of acceleration data, however, can be complex, as the static (indicative of posture) and dynamic (motion) components are derived from the total acceleration values, which should ideally be recorded in all 3-dimensional axes. The principles of triaxial accelerometry are summarised and discussed in terms of the commonalities that arise in patterns of acceleration across species that vary in body pattern, life-history strategy, and the medium they inhabit. Using tri-axial acceleration data from deployments on captive and free-living animals (n = 12 species), behaviours were identified that varied in complexity, from the rhythmic patterns of locomotion, to feeding, and more variable patterns including those relating to social interactions. These data can be combined with positional information to qualify patterns of area-use and map the distribution of target behaviours. The range and distribution of behaviour may also provide insight into the transmission of disease. In this way, the measurement of tri-axial acceleration can provide insight into individual and population level processes, which may ultimately influence the effectiveness of conservation practice.},

abstract = {Recent advances in biologging open promising perspectives in the study of animal movements at numerous scales. It is now possible to record time series of animal locations and ancillary data (e.g. activity level derived from on-board accelerometers) over extended areas and long durations with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Such time series are often piecewise stationary, as the animal may alternate between different stationary phases (i.e. characterized by a specific mean and variance of some key parameter for limited periods). Identifying when these phases start and end is a critical first step to understand the dynamics of the underlying movement processes. We introduce a new segmentation-clustering method we called segclust2d (available as a r package at cran.r-project.org/package=segclust2d). It can segment bivariate (or more generally multivariate) time series and possibly cluster the various segments obtained, corresponding to different phases assumed to be stationary. This method is easy to use, as it only requires specifying a minimum segment length (to prevent over-segmentation), based on biological rather than statistical considerations. This method can be applied to bivariate piecewise time series of any nature. We focus here on two types of time series related to animal movement, corresponding to (a) at large scale, series of bivariate coordinates of relocations, to highlight temporary home ranges, and (b) at smaller scale, bivariate series derived from relocations data, such as speed and turning angle, to highlight different behavioural modes such as transit, feeding and resting. Using computer simulations, we show that segclust2d can rival and even outperform previous, more complex methods, which were specifically developed to highlight changes of movement modes or home range shifts (based on hidden Markov and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck modelling), which, contrary to our method, usually require the user to provide relevant initial guesses to be efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate it on actual examples involving a zebra's small-scale movements and an elephant's large-scale movements, to illustrate how various movement modes and home range shifts, respectively, can be identified.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

In this study the Beverton and Holt invariants were obtained from maximization of the fecundity function that optimizes the trade-off between survival and fecundity; this approach applies conventional fishery models and provides estimates of the constants C1, C2, and C3. These estimates can be compared with the estimates obtained by regression of 1/M on xm, M on K, and L(xm) on Linf across species and across populations within species. The values of the constants obtained from regression across species agree closely with the theoretical values of the constants. In fishery assessments, natural mortality is often approximated using growth parameters, and the analyses reported here indicate that the relations are not just statistical relations, but rather result from fundamental ecological relations among the parameters. {\textcopyright}1996 NRC Canada.},

abstract = {Movement is important to all organisms, and accordingly it is addressed in a huge number of papers in the literature. Of nearly 26,000 papers referring to movement, an estimated 34{\%} focused on movement by measuring it or testing hypotheses about it. This enormous amount of information is difficult to review and highlights the need to assess the collective completeness of movement studies and identify gaps. We surveyed 1,000 randomly selected papers from 496 journals and compared the facets of movement studied with a suggested framework for movement ecology, consisting of internal state (motivation, physiology), motion and navigation capacities, and external factors (both the physical environment and living organisms), and links among these components. Most studies simply measured and described the movement of organisms without reference to ecological or internal factors, and the most frequently studied part of the framework was the link between external factors and motion capacity. Few studies looked at the effects on movement of navigation capacity, or internal state, and those were mainly from vertebrates. For invertebrates and plants most studies were at the population level, whereas more vertebrate studies were conducted at the individual level. Consideration of only population-level averages promulgates neglect of between-individual variation in movement, potentially hindering the study of factors controlling movement. Terminology was found to be inconsistent among taxa and subdisciplines. The gaps identified in coverage of movement studies highlight research areas that should be addressed to fully understand the ecology of movement. {\textcopyright}2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

These data together with environmental data from satellite remote sensing are used to describe the oceanic habitat used by these turtles. The results indicate that loggerheads travel westward, move seasonally north and south primarily through the region 28–40N, and occupy sea surface temperatures (SST) of 15–25C. Their dive depth distribution indicated that they spend 40{\%} of their time at the surface and 90{\%} of their time at depths {\textless}40 m. Loggerheads are found in association with fronts, eddies, and geostrophic currents. Specifically, the Transition Zone Chlorophyll Front (TZCF) and the southern edge of the Kuroshio Extension Current (KEC) appear to be important forage and migration habitats for loggerheads. In contrast, olive ridleys were found primarily south of loggerhead habitat in the region 8–31N latitude, occupying warmer water with SSTs of 23– 28C. They have a deeper dive pattern than loggerheads, spending only 20{\%} of their time at the surface and 60{\%} shallower than 40 m. However, the three olive ridleys identified from genetics to be of western Pacific origin spent some time associated with major ocean currents, specifically the southern edge of the KEC, the North Equatorial Current (NEC), and the Equatorial Counter Current (ECC). These habitats were not used by any olive ridleys of eastern Pacific origin suggesting that olive ridleys from different populations may occupy different oceanic habitats.},

Because of their charismatic megafauna and imperiled status, there is considerable interest as to how species in this taxon have responded to recent ocean warming and may respond to predicted warming trends. The fact that they are wide-ranging and evolutionarily ancient organisms suggests that marine turtles withstood changing climatic conditions in the past. To test if there are thermal cues that relate to dynamic nesting behaviours of loggerheads Caretta caretta and green turtles Chelonia mydas, we examined 20 yr (1989–2008) data sets of beach monitoring surveys and satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) from an important nesting site in east central Florida, USA, and adjacent Atlantic waters, respectively. For both species, median nesting dates became significantly earlier with higher May SSTs. However, the standard deviation of nest distributions, used as an analog for nesting season length, decreased for loggerheads and, in contrast, increased for green turtles with a higher average daily SST. This differential response between the species may reflect changes in reproductive physiology (e.g. internesting interval times and clutch numbers) and could have bearing on the future population dynamics of the 2 species.},

abstract = {Incubation period, hatching success, and emergence percentage in loggerhead (Caretta caretta) nests were quantified during the 1993 and 1995 nesting seasons and following incubation seasons in Minabe, Wakayama, Japan. Sand and nest temperatures were also monitored. Over the seasons, daily mean sand temperature at nest depth fluctuated between 18.0C and 33.3C, with a steep increase in the second week of July and a peak in late August. Temperatures inside the nest chambers were a few degrees above those of the sur- rounding sand at the end of incubation. The incubation period ranged from 46 to 82 days. A significant negative correlation was found between mean sand temperature and incubation period. The relationship conformed to the day-degree concept. There was no significant sea- sonal trend in hatching success, but many pre-emergent hatchlings were found dead in most of the clutches dur- ing the warmest part of the season. Emergence percent-age was correlated with mean sand temperature calculated for 4 days before emergence, suggesting that mortality may be due to heat. This heat-related mortality is considered to be a common phenomenon at our study site, because the peak in emergences coincides with the peak in high temperatures. These temperature effects on hatchling mortality must be taken into account in esti- mates of hatchling sex ratios. Because sand temperatures already exceed the optimal thermal range for incubation, this population is vulnerable to even small temperature increases resulting from global warming.},

abstract = {In the South Atlantic Ocean, few data exist regarding the dispersal of young oceanic sea turtles. We characterized the movements of laboratory-reared yearling loggerhead turtles from Brazilian rookeries using novel telemetry techniques, testing for differences in dispersal during different periods of the sea turtle hatching season that correspond to seasonal changes in ocean currents. Oceanographic drifters deployed alongside satellite-tagged turtles allowed us to explore the mechanisms of dispersal (passive drift or active swimming). Early in the hatching season turtles transited south with strong southward currents. Late in the hatching season, when currents flowed in the opposite direction, turtles uniformly moved northwards across the Equator. However, the movement of individuals differed from what was predicted by surface currents alone. Swimming velocity inferred from track data and an ocean circulation model strongly suggest that turtles' swimming plays a role in maintaining their position within frontal zones seaward of the continental shelf. The long nesting season of adults and behaviour of posthatchlings exposes young turtles to seasonally varying ocean conditions that lead some individuals further into the South Atlantic and others into the Northern Hemisphere. Such migratory route diversity may ultimately buffer the population against environmental changes or anthropologic threats, fostering population resiliency.},

abstract = {A method for studying animal movements based on data from independent data-logging acoustic receivers is described. The method takes presence or absence data from multiple receivers arranged in an array and converts them to position estimates based on weighted means of the number of signal receptions at each receiver during a specified time period. The method is equivalent to a short-term center of activity rather than a precise estimate of location at a single time. The utility of the method was assessed using data from a study of neonate blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus). Periods between 5 and 60 min were tested to find the most appropriate interval for estimating positions. The results from the method agreed closely with a simulated shark track and data from actively tracked sharks. The median distances between successive locations from the mean-position algorithm were between 28{\%} and 42{\%} of those from active tracking because of the center-of-activity nature of the method. The results presented demonstrate that the technique provides a useful method for investigating long-term movement patterns, space utilization patterns over broader areas, and home range.},

We attached satellite transmitters (MK10 Pat Tags) to 10 post-nesting East Pacific green turtles Chelonia mydas from Nombre de Jes{\'{u}}s, Costa Rica (in 2006, 2007 and 2009) to track their movements, identify their foraging grounds, and elucidate their foraging behavior. Location data were analyzed by applying a switching state-space model to obtain daily position estimates and to differentiate between 2 behavioral modes (migrating and foraging). All post-nesting movements were along coastal routes ranging up to 1086 km from the nesting beach. Of the 10 turtles, 6 remained local residents of Costa Rica foraging in the Gulf of Papagayo (N = 2) and the Gulf of Santa Elena (N = 4). One individual moved southwards to the Gulf of Panama, and 3 other turtles migrated northwards to waters off the Gulf of Fonseca in northern Nicaragua, with one continuing its foraging movements northwards to coastal Guatemala. Home ranges during foraging varied widely among individuals, and the calculated size of feeding grounds ranged from 315 to 18 335 km2, the latter being the largest reported for this species. The fact that members of this nesting population inhabit coastal waters makes them vulnerable to human activities along the coasts of Central America. Our findings highlight the importance of Costa Rica and the coastal waters of Central America for the survival of the Endangered Costa Rican green turtles. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract = {Wind energy production has expanded to meet climate change mitigation goals, but negative impacts of wind turbines have been reported on wildlife. Soaring birds are among the most affected groups with alarming fatality rates by collision with wind turbines and an escalating occupation of their migratory corridors. These birds have been described as changing their flight trajectories to avoid wind turbines, but this behaviour may lead to functional habitat loss, as suitable soaring areas in the proximity of wind turbines will likely be underused. We modelled the displacement effect of wind turbines on black kites (Milvus migrans) tracked by GPS. We also evaluated the impact of this effect at the scale of the landscape by estimating how much suitable soaring area was lost to wind turbines. We used state-of-the-art tracking devices to monitor the movements of 130 black kites in an area populated by wind turbines, at the migratory bottleneck of the Strait of Gibraltar. Landscape use by birds was mapped from GPS data using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models, and generalized additive mixed modelling was used to estimate the effect of wind turbine proximity on bird use while accounting for orographic and thermal uplift availability. We found that areas up to approximately 674 m away from the turbines were less used than expected given their uplift potential. Within that distance threshold, bird use decreased with the proximity to wind turbines. We estimated that the footprint of wind turbines affected 3{\%}–14{\%} of the areas suitable for soaring in our study area. We present evidence that the impacts of wind energy industry on soaring birds are greater than previously acknowledged. In addition to the commonly reported fatalities, the avoidance of turbines by soaring birds causes habitat losses in their movement corridors. Authorities should recognize this further impact of wind energy production and establish new regulations that protect soaring habitat. We also showed that soaring habitat for birds can be modelled at a fine scale using publicly available data. Such an approach can be used to plan low-impact placement of turbines in new wind energy developments.},

abstract = {The thermal biology of sea turtles depends upon the heat transfer properties of their environment as well as the physical and physiological characteristics of the turtles. In water, heat loss predominates over heat gain but on land, lethal heat gain during the day is one factor that selects for nocturnal nesting activity. Small turtles, Lepidochelys sp. and Eretmochelys imbricata, can nest during the day, if exposed to wind, because they are less affected by solar radiation than larger species since they lose more heat via convection. Sea turtles employ both behavioral and physiological thermoregulation. Loggerheads, Caretta caretta, can raise body temperatures (Tb) 3.8 C above ocean temperatures by basking in water and green turtles, Chelonia mydas, can elevate Tb 5 C above ocean tem- peratures by basking on land. Large turtles are endothermic. Green turtles ex- hibit regional endothermy, with active tissues 8 C above ocean temperatures during vigorous swimming. Leatherback turtles, Dermochelys coriacea, have body temperatures as much as 18 C above an ambient water temperature of 7.5 C. Multichannel telemetry demonstrates that the internal temperatures of a resting leatherback are higher than carapace and ambient air temperatures indicating that heat is generated internally and not absorbed from the environment.},

abstract = {Background: With increasing interest in animal social networks, field biologists have started exploring the use of advanced tracking technologies for mapping social encounters in free-ranging subjects. Proximity logging, which involves the use of animal-borne tags with the capacity for two-way communication, has attracted particular attention in recent years. While the basic rationale of proximity logging is straightforward, systems generate very large datasets which pose considerable challenges in terms of processing and visualisation. Technical aspects of data handling are crucial for the success of proximity-logging studies, yet are only rarely reported in full detail. Here, we describe the procedures we employed for mining the data generated by a recent deployment of a novel proximity-logging system, "Encounternet", to study social-network dynamics in tool-using New Caledonian crows. Results: Our field deployment of an Encounternet system produced some 240,000 encounter logs for 33 crows over a 19-day study period. Using this dataset, we illustrate a range of procedures, including: examination of tag reciprocity (i.e. whether both tags participating in an encounter detected the encounter and, if so, whether their records differed); filtering of data according to a predetermined signal-strength criterion (to enable analyses that focus on encounters within a particular distance range); amalgamation of temporally clustered encounter logs (to remove data artefacts and to enable robust analysis of biological patterns); and visualisation of dynamic network data as timeline plots (which can be used, among other things, to visualise the simulated diffusion of information). Conclusions: Researchers wishing to study animal social networks with proximity-logging systems should be aware of the complexities involved. Successful data analysis requires not only a sound understanding of hardware and software operation, but also bioinformatics expertise. Our paper aims to facilitate future projects by explaining in detail some of the subtleties that are easily overlooked in first-pass analyses, but are key for reaching valid biological conclusions. We hope that this work will prove useful to other researchers, especially when read in conjunction with three recently published companion papers that report aspects of system calibration and key results.},

Our data indicate that foraging area preference influences the size, fecun-dity, and breeding periodicity of adult female loggerhead turtles. We also found that the proportion of turtles originating from each foraging area varied significantly among the years examined. The change in the number of nest-ing females across the years of the study was not a result of uniform change from all foraging areas. We develop a novel approach to assess differential contributions of vari-ous foraging aggregations to changes in abundance of a sea turtle nesting aggregation using stable isotopes. Our approach can provide an improved understanding of the influences on the causes of increasing or decreasing popu-lation trends and allow more effective monitoring for these threatened species and other highly migratory species.},

abstract = {Recent advances in biologging open promising perspectives in the study of animal movements at numerous scales. It is now possible to record time series of animal locations and ancillary data (e.g. activity level derived from on-board accelerometers) over extended areas and long durations with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Such time series are often piecewise stationary, as the animal may alternate between different stationary phases (i.e. characterized by a specific mean and variance of some key parameter for limited periods). Identifying when these phases start and end is a critical first step to understand the dynamics of the underlying movement processes. We introduce a new segmentation-clustering method we called segclust2d (available as a r package at cran.r-project.org/package=segclust2d). It can segment bivariate (or more generally multivariate) time series and possibly cluster the various segments obtained, corresponding to different phases assumed to be stationary. This method is easy to use, as it only requires specifying a minimum segment length (to prevent over-segmentation), based on biological rather than statistical considerations. This method can be applied to bivariate piecewise time series of any nature. We focus here on two types of time series related to animal movement, corresponding to (a) at large scale, series of bivariate coordinates of relocations, to highlight temporary home ranges, and (b) at smaller scale, bivariate series derived from relocations data, such as speed and turning angle, to highlight different behavioural modes such as transit, feeding and resting. Using computer simulations, we show that segclust2d can rival and even outperform previous, more complex methods, which were specifically developed to highlight changes of movement modes or home range shifts (based on hidden Markov and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck modelling), which, contrary to our method, usually require the user to provide relevant initial guesses to be efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate it on actual examples involving a zebra's small-scale movements and an elephant's large-scale movements, to illustrate how various movement modes and home range shifts, respectively, can be identified.},

abstract = {To prevent further global declines in biodiversity, identifying and understanding key habitats is crucial for successful conservation strategies. For example, globally, seabird populations are under threat and animal movement data can identify key at-sea areas and provide valuable information on the state of marine ecosystems. To date, in order to locate these areas, studies have used global positioning system (GPS) to record position and are sometimes combined with time–depth recorder (TDR) devices to identify diving activity associated with foraging, a crucial aspect of at-sea behaviour. However, the use of additional devices such as TDRs can be expensive, logistically difficult and may adversely affect the animal. Alternatively, behaviours may be resolved from measurements derived from the movement data alone. However, this behavioural analysis frequently lacks validation data for locations predicted as foraging (or other behaviours). Here, we address these issues using a combined GPS and TDR dataset from 108 individuals by training deep learning models to predict diving in European shags, common guillemots and razorbills. We validate our predictions using withheld data, producing quantitative assessment of predictive accuracy. The variables used to train these models are those recorded solely by the GPS device: variation in longitude and latitude, altitude and coverage ratio (proportion of possible fixes acquired within a set window of time). Different combinations of these variables were used to explore the qualities of different models, with the optimum models for all species predicting non-diving and diving behaviour correctly over 94{\%} and 80{\%} of the time, respectively. We also demonstrate the superior predictive ability of these supervised deep learning models over other commonly used behavioural prediction methods such as hidden Markov models. Mapping these predictions provides useful insights into the foraging activity of a range of seabird species, highlighting important at sea locations. These models have the potential to be used to analyse historic GPS datasets and further our understanding of how environmental changes have affected these seabirds over time.},

abstract = {Mediterranean populations of loggerhead Caretta caretta and green sea turtles Chelonia mydas are subject to several anthropogenic threats, with documented mortality from incidental capture in fishing gear. However, how such mortalities actually affect the populations is uncertain without an estimate of population size. We derived a theoretical demographic structure for each species in the Mediterranean, assuming a stationary age distribution in a stable population with constant proportions of turtles in each life stage, using distributions of age-specific vital rates. We incorporated uncertainty into the main vital rate parameters to identify a likely order of magnitude of turtle abundance in different life stages. Through this approach, we aim to (1) provide a rough estimate of all population stage classes, particularly the juvenile classes that are most subject to fisheries interactions, (2) provide an estimate of reproductive life span, (3) identify and review the key demographic parameters, and (4) identify the priority gaps in our information in need of further investigation. The range of population abundance estimates from the models constructed with uncertainty (95{\%} CI) was 0.81-3.38 million loggerheads and 0.26-2.21 million green turtles, Mediterranean-wide. When we calculated the potential biological removal for the segment of the population at risk of fisheries capture, our estimates were comparable to or lower than the estimated bycatch levels in fisheries. Although the model assumes a stable population and provides only a rough estimate of abundance, these results suggest that the current bycatch level should be regarded as unsustainable for Mediterranean turtle populations.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the mechanisms influencing phenology can provide insights into the adaptability of species to climate change. Here, we investigated the factors influencing multidecadal trends in the nesting phenology of the leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea at Playa Grande, Costa Rica, in the eastern Pacific Ocean and at Sandy Point, US Virgin Islands, in the western Atlantic Ocean. Between 1993 and 2013, the median nesting date (MND) at Playa Grande occurred later, at a rate of [approximately]0.3 d yr-1. In contrast, between 1982 and 2010, the MND at Sandy Point occurred earlier, at a rate of [approximately]0.17 d yr-1. The opposing trends in the MND of each population were not explained by variation in the multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation index, North Atlantic Oscillation index, or Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index; however, the MND at Playa Grande was significantly correlated with nesting population size. We propose that changes in demography, linked to the population decline at Playa Grande, and the population recovery at Sandy Point may explain the contrasting trends in MNDs. If the observed trends in MND continue into the future, the nesting season at Playa Grande will coincide with increasingly adverse conditions for hatching success, exacerbating the already detrimental effects of climate change. Alternatively, shifts in the nesting phenology may make the Atlantic populations more resilient to climate change. Our findings highlight the increasing need for conservation efforts for eastern Pacific leatherback turtles to consider climate change mitigation practices.},

abstract = {Many animals, including sea turtles, alter their movements and home range in relation to the particular type and quality of the habitat occupied. When sufficient resources are available, individuals may develop affinities to specific areas for activities, such as foraging and (or) resting. In the case of green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas L.), after a number of years in the open ocean, juveniles recruit to shallow-water developmental habitats where they occupy distinct home ranges as they feed and grow to maturity. Our goal was to study the habitat use and home range movements of juvenile green turtles along a shallow, worm-rock reef tract in Palm Beach, Florida. Six turtles, measuring from 27.9 to 48.1 cm in straight carapace length and from 7.2 to 12.6 kg in mass, were tracked via ultrasonic telemetry from August to November 2003. Upon capture, each turtle's esophagus was flushed via lavage to determine recently ingested foods. In addition, four turtles were recaptured and fitted with a time-depth recorder to study dive patterns. Home range areas measured with 100{\%} minimum convex polygon and 95{\%} fixed kernel estimators varied from 0.69 to 5.05 km2 (mean=2.38±1.78 km2) and 0.73 to 4.89 km2 (mean=2.09±1.80 km2), respectively. Home ranges and core areas of turtles were largely restricted to the reef tract itself, and showed considerable overlap between food and shelter sites. The mean number of dives during daylight hours (0600– 1800 hours) was 84±5.0 dives, while the mean during night hours (1800–0600 hours) was 39±3.0 dives. Dives during the day were shallower (mean=3.20±1.26 m) than dives at night (mean=5.59±0.09 m). All six turtles were found to have a mixed diet of similar macroalgae and sponge fragments. Our results reveal that juvenile green turtles occupy stable home ranges along the nearshore worm-rock reefs of Southeast Florida, during the summer and fall. Determining which habitats are used by green turtles will assist conservation managers in their global effort to protect this endangered species.},

We tested the effect of a mixed diet versus a single-food diet on metamorphic competence in the emerging model species Crepidula fornicata. We then com pared our results with other published studies on this species that examined time to metamorphic competence across a range of food concentrations and rearing temperatures. Ours was the only study to test the effects of single food versus a mixed diet on metamorphic competence for this species. Diet composition did not affect metamorphic competence or survivorship. Comparing results across studies, we found that the shortest time to metamorphic competence was typ ically found when the food availability per larva was the greatest, independent of rearing temperature. Unfortunately, some published studies did not include important metadata needed for comparison with other studies; these data in cluded larval rearing density, food density, frequency of feeding, and rearing temperature. Mortality rates were not always reported and when reported were often measured in different ways, preventing comparison. Such metadata are essential for comparisons among studies as well as among taxa, and for the determination of generalizable patterns and evolutionary trends. Increased reporting of all such meta data is essential if we are to use scientific studies performed to their fullest potential},

These tracks were fit with a switching state-space model to characterize movements and then analyzed in relation to environmental and anthropogenic factors. Inter-nesting movements of two turtles included separate oceanic loops, in which turtles traveled {\textgreater} 40 km away from nesting beaches. Four complete migrations were observed to two distinct foraging grounds, with two turtles migrating west for an average of 1064 km to the coastal waters of Ghana, and two migrating south for an average of 1563 km to a newly discovered foraging ground in the coastal waters of Angola. All migrations included intermittent foraging at stopover sites, including one period of possible oceanic foraging. Turtles at both foraging grounds maintained distinct core use areas in shallow, near-shore ({\textless} 20 km from coast) waters. Spatial and depth data reveal critical habitats for this population throughout inter-nesting, post-nesting, and foraging behaviors. Tracks spanned nine countries, highlighting the need for multi-national cooperation in the development of marine conservation management plans in the area. The long distances covered by these turtles suggests that fisheries bycatch and direct harvest throughout the East Atlantic may impact this population. Additionally, spatial and dive depth data can inform zonal fishing regulations and provide the information needed to modify fishing practices and gear in ways likely to reduce sea turtle bycatch.},

abstract = {Atlantic leatherback sea turtles migrate annually from foraging grounds off eastern Canada and the northeastern United States to southern foraging and breeding areas. Using Cox's proportional hazards model, we investigated the individual timing of the southward migrations of 27 turtles equipped with satellite-linked transmitters off Nova Scotia compared with turtle characteristics and satellite-measured ocean variables. Latitude, longitude, 1-week lagged average sea surface temperature, and 1-week lagged average chlorophyll-a concentration appear to influence the probability of departure. Higher temperature and, in the northern range of the study, higher chlorophyll concentration increased departure rates, perhaps due to the acceleration of the life cycle of the leatherback's gelatinous prey and/or increased feeding efficiency in these areas. This study highlights the opportunity to use satellite telemetry and environmental data to examine the cues for and timing of animal migrations and expands the study of migration timing to include a new species and environment. {\textcopyright} The Author 2007.

abstract = {Modeling animal movements is fundamental to animal ecology as it provides the foundation for further exploration into mechanisms affecting individual and population-level processes. In the last few decades, biotelemetry has enabled scientists to track the movements of marine life across a variety of scales. However, the use of such technology is progressing faster than the analytical techniques for modeling movement patterns. In summer 2012, we deployed an acoustic telemetry array around Culebra, Puerto Rico, consisting of 48 remote receivers that can detect coded transmissions sent by tags implanted in fish. We surgically implanted transmitters in bonefish ( n= 28), great barracuda ( n= 2) and permit ( n= 1) as part of a multi-year study. In January 2013, we downloaded over 850,000 detections from 39 receivers for 31 fish (several receivers had zero fish detections, and two receivers were not downloaded), and used that six-month data set to explore how graph theory and network analysis can be used to model the movement ecology of the tagged fish. We analyzed this data as two types of graphs. First, a bipartite graph was constructed by linking each fish with an edge weighted by the number of detections of that fish by that receiver. Bipartite graphs are not explicitly spatial, but rather represent which fish associate with which receivers. Second, spatial movement graphs for individuals were built by linking receivers (nodes) by edges with the number of times each fish moved along that edge as weights. The bipartite graph identified groups of fish visiting the same sites, and groups of sites visited by the same fish. Of the six community detection algorithms used, Multilevel, Fast-Greedy, and Walk-Trap performed best, with similar module partitions and modularity scores. All three of these algorithms produced modules (groups) that appear to reflect working hypotheses related to the coastal bathymetry, habitat types, and associated movement ecology of the tagged species. Spatial movement graphs were very different for each fish examined and reflect behavioral differences. Fish exhibited various movement patterns, some showing the pattern of a central place forager (bonefish), while others cruised along a territory (great barracuda and permit).},

abstract = {The Gulf of Papagayo at the northern Pacific coast of Costa Rica experiences pronounced seasonal changes in water parameters caused by wind-driven coastal upwelling. While remote sensing and open water sampling already described the physical nature of this upwelling, the spatial and temporal effects on key parameters and processes in the water column have not been investigated yet, although being highly relevant for coral reef functioning. The present study investigated a range of water parameters on two coral reefs with different exposure to upwelling (Matapalo and Bajo Rojo) in a weekly to monthly resolution over one year (May 2013 to April 2014). Based on air temperature, wind speed and water temperature, three time clusters were defined: a) May to November 2013 without upwelling, b) December 2013 to April 2014 with moderate upwelling, punctuated by c) extreme upwelling events in February, March and April 2014. During upwelling peaks, water temperatures decreased by 7°C (Matapalo) and 9°C (Bajo Rojo) to minima of 20.1 and 15.3°C respectively, while phosphate, ammonia and nitrate concentrations increased 3 to 15-fold to maxima of 1.3 $\mu$mol PO43- L-1, 3.0 $\mu$mol NH4+ L-1 and 9.7 $\mu$mol NO3-L-1. This increased availability of nutrients triggered several successive phytoplankton blooms as indicated by 3-(Matapalo) and 6-fold (Bajo Rojo) increases in chlorophyll a concentrations. Particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (POC and PON) increased by 40 and 70{\%} respectively from February to April 2014. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased by 70{\%} in December and stayed elevated for at least 4 months, indicating high organic matter release by primary producers. Such strong cascading effects of upwelling on organic matter dynamics on coral reefs have not been reported previously, although likely impacting many reefs in comparable upwelling systems.},

abstract = {Wind-driven coastal ocean upwelling supplies nutrients to the euphotic zone near the coast. Nutrients fuel the growth of phytoplankton, the base of a very productive coastal marine ecosystem [Pauly D, Christensen V (1995) Nature 374:255-257]. Because nutrient supply and phytoplankton biomass in shelf waters are highly sensitive to variation in upwelling-driven circulation, shifts in the timing and strength of upwelling may alter basic nutrient and carbon fluxes through marine food webs. We show how a 1-month delay in the 2005 spring transition to upwelling-favorable wind stress in the northern California Current Large Marine Ecosystem resulted in numerous anomalies: warm water, low nutrient levels, low primary productivity, and an unprecedented low recruitment of rocky intertidal organisms. The delay was associated with 20- to 40-day wind oscillations accompanying a southward shift of the jet stream. Early in the upwelling season (May-July) off Oregon, the cumulative upwelling-favorable wind stress was the lowest in 20 years, nearshore surface waters averaged 2°C warmer than normal, surf-zone chlorophyll-a and nutrients were 50{\%} and 30{\%} less than normal, respectively, and densities of recruits of mussels and barnacles were reduced by 83{\%} and 66{\%}, respectively. Delayed early-season upwelling and stronger late-season upwelling are consistent with predictions of the influence of global warming on coastal upwelling regions. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {The complex processes involved with animalmigration have long been a subject of biological interest, and broad-scale movement patterns ofmanymarine turtle populations still remain unresolved. While it is widely accepted that once marine turtles reach sexual maturity they home to natal areas for nesting or reproduction, the role of philopatry to natal areas during other life stages has received less scrutiny, despite widespread evidence across the taxa. Here we report on genetic research that indicates that juvenile hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) in the eastern Pacific Ocean use foraging grounds in the region of their natal beaches, a pattern we term natal foraging philopatry. Our findings confirm that traditional views of natal homing solely for reproduction are incomplete and that many marine turtle species exhibit philopatry to natal areas to forage. Our results have important implications for life-history research and conservation of marine turtles and may extend to other wide-rangingmarine vertebrates that demonstrate natal philopatry.},

abstract = {The Costa Rica Dome is similar to other tropical thermocline domes in several respects: it is part of an east-west thermocline ridge associated with the equatorial circulation, surface currents flow cyclonically around it, and its seasonal evolution is affected by large-scale wind patterns. The Costa Rica Dome is unique because it is also forced by a coastal wind jet. Monthly climatological fields of thermocline depth and physical forcing variables (wind stress curl and surface current divergence) were analyzed to examine the structure and seasonal evolution of the dome. The annual cycle of the dome can be explained by wind forcing in four stages: (1) coastal shoaling of the thermocline off the Gulf of Papagayo during February-April, forced by Ekman pumping on the equatorward side of the Papagayo wind jet; (2) separation from the coast during May-June when the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) moves north to the countercurrent thermocline ridge, the wind jet stops, and the North Equatorial Countercurrent extends toward the coast on the equatorward flank of the ridge; (3) countercurrent thermocline ridging during July-November, when the dome expands to the west as the countercurrent thermocline ridge shoals beneath a band of cyclonic wind stress curl on the poleward side of the ITCZ; and (4) deepening during December-January when the ITCZ moves south and strong trade winds blow over the dome. Coastal eddies may be involved in the coastal shoaling observed during February-March. A seasonally predictable, strong, and shallow thermocline makes the Costa Rica Dome a distinct biological habitat where phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass are higher than in surrounding tropical waters. The physical structure and biological productivity of the dome affect the distribution and feeding of whales and dolphins, probably through forage availability.},

abstract = {Understanding the spatial ecology of wide-ranging marine species is fundamental to advancing ecological research and species management. For marine turtles, genetic studies using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers have proven invaluable to characterize movement, particularly between rookeries (i.e. nesting sites) and foraging grounds. Hawksbill turtles Eretmochelys imbricata are a globally threatened species whose conservation status is particularly precarious in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Recent research in the region has identified unique life history characteristics, including highly restricted movements, the use of mangrove estuaries for foraging and nesting, as well as a regional pattern of natal foraging philopatry (NFP). For this study, we used mtDNA sequences and mixed-stock analysis of hawksbills from 8 designated foraging grounds and 5 primary rookeries to evaluate stock composition at each foraging ground, assess how stock contributions are affected by the NFP life history strategy, and search for evidence of unidentified rookeries. Although we found evidence supporting the NFP pattern at most foraging grounds, results indicated important site-specific variability at particular foraging grounds. We also found discrepancies among the haplotype frequencies of several foraging grounds and rookeries, as well as the presence of several orphan haplotypes, suggesting undiscovered hawksbill rookeries likely remain in the eastern Pacific. Our findings contextualize the prevalence and scale of the NFP life history strategy and provide insights that can be directly applied to future ecological research and species management and conservation.},

abstract = {It is fundamentally important for many animal ecologists to quantify the costs of animal activities, although it is not straightforward to do so. The recording of triaxial acceleration by animal-attached devices has been proposed as a way forward for this, with the specific suggestion that dynamic body acceleration (DBA) be used as a proxy for movement-based power. Dynamic body acceleration has now been validated frequently, both in the laboratory and in the field, although the literature still shows that some aspects of DBA theory and practice are misunderstood. Here, we examine the theory behind DBA and employ modelling approaches to assess factors that affect the link between DBA and energy expenditure, from the deployment of the tag, through to the calibration of DBA with energy use in laboratory and field settings. Using data from a range of species and movement modes, we illustrate that vectorial and additive DBA metrics are proportional to each other. Either can be used as a proxy for energy and summed to estimate total energy expended over a given period, or divided by time to give a proxy for movement-related metabolic power. Nonetheless, we highlight how the ability of DBA to predict metabolic rate declines as the contribution of non-movement-related factors, such as heat production, increases. Overall, DBA seems to be a substantive proxy for movement-based power but consideration of other movement-related metrics, such as the static body acceleration and the rate of change of body pitch and roll, may enable researchers to refine movement-based metabolic costs, particularly in animals where movement is not characterized by marked changes in body acceleration.},

abstract = {Modeling animal movements is fundamental to animal ecology as it provides the foundation for further exploration into mechanisms affecting individual and population-level processes. In the last few decades, biotelemetry has enabled scientists to track the movements of marine life across a variety of scales. However, the use of such technology is progressing faster than the analytical techniques for modeling movement patterns. In summer 2012, we deployed an acoustic telemetry array around Culebra, Puerto Rico, consisting of 48 remote receivers that can detect coded transmissions sent by tags implanted in fish. We surgically implanted transmitters in bonefish ( n= 28), great barracuda ( n= 2) and permit ( n= 1) as part of a multi-year study. In January 2013, we downloaded over 850,000 detections from 39 receivers for 31 fish (several receivers had zero fish detections, and two receivers were not downloaded), and used that six-month data set to explore how graph theory and network analysis can be used to model the movement ecology of the tagged fish. We analyzed this data as two types of graphs. First, a bipartite graph was constructed by linking each fish with an edge weighted by the number of detections of that fish by that receiver. Bipartite graphs are not explicitly spatial, but rather represent which fish associate with which receivers. Second, spatial movement graphs for individuals were built by linking receivers (nodes) by edges with the number of times each fish moved along that edge as weights. The bipartite graph identified groups of fish visiting the same sites, and groups of sites visited by the same fish. Of the six community detection algorithms used, Multilevel, Fast-Greedy, and Walk-Trap performed best, with similar module partitions and modularity scores. All three of these algorithms produced modules (groups) that appear to reflect working hypotheses related to the coastal bathymetry, habitat types, and associated movement ecology of the tagged species. Spatial movement graphs were very different for each fish examined and reflect behavioral differences. Fish exhibited various movement patterns, some showing the pattern of a central place forager (bonefish), while others cruised along a territory (great barracuda and permit).},

abstract = {While little is known about hawksbill turtles Eretmochelys imbricata in the eastern Pacific Ocean, available information suggests that the population has declined substantially in recent decades and could be near extirpation in the region. To evaluate the current status of the population more effectively and to determine the feasibility of recovery efforts, a workshop of regional marine turtle specialists was held in June 2008 in Los Cbanos, El Salvador. An international working group, Iniciativa Carey del Pacfico Oriental (ICAPO; Eastern Pacific Hawksbill Initiative in English), was established to consolidate information, promote conservation projects and raise awareness about the species. We present information derived from the workshop and compiled by the ICAPO working group since that time. Considering only records from 1 January 2007 to 31 May 2009 it appears that El Salvador hosts the majority of known hawksbill turtle nesting activity in the eastern Pacific, with 79.6{\%} (n = 430) of all nesting observation records, and Mexico hosts the majority of records of hawksbill turtles at sea, with 60.3{\%} (n = 44) of all in-water observation records. Although current abundance is very low, the pervasiveness of the species in the region suggests potential for conservation and recovery. Despite a historical paucity of research focusing on this population, the relatively large and steadily increasing number of records as a result of concerted efforts demonstrates the viability of the ICAPO network as an instrument to promote conservation of this species in the eastern Pacific. {\textcopyright}2010 Fauna {\&} Flora International.},

abstract = {This review highlights some recent important developments in our understanding of the physiological, behavioural and molecular ecology of sea turtles as well as their conservation biology. Key commonalities are identified between the biological questions being addressed with respect to sea turtles compared to those with marine mammals (e.g. pinnipeds and whales), birds (e.g. albatrosses) and fish (e.g. tuna, swordfish and pelagic sharks). Key areas highlighted include (1) objectively identifying oceanic hotspots; (2) measuring what animals are actually doing in different parts of their range (e.g. foraging) rather than simply inferring their state from their position and movement; (3) completing energy budgets for species over ecologically relevant timescales (e.g. the period between breeding seasons); (4) using biological information to help drive conservation management; and (5) assessing the impact of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Light-level geolocator tags use ambient light recordings to estimate the whereabouts of an individual over the time it carried the device. Over the past decade, these tags have emerged as an important tool and have been used extensively for tracking animal migrations, most commonly small birds. Analysing geolocator data can be daunting to new and experienced scientists alike. Over the past decades, several methods with fundamental differences in the analytical approach have been developed to cope with the various caveats and the often complicated data. Here, we explain the concepts behind the analyses of geolocator data and provide a practical guide for the common steps encompassing most analyses – annotation of twilights, calibration, estimating and refining locations, and extraction of movement patterns – describing good practices and common pitfalls for each step. We discuss criteria for deciding whether or not geolocators can answer proposed research questions, provide guidance in choosing an appropriate analysis method and introduce key features of the newest open-source analysis tools. We provide advice for how to interpret and report results, highlighting parameters that should be reported in publications and included in data archiving. Finally, we introduce a comprehensive supplementary online manual that applies the concepts to several datasets, demonstrates the use of open-source analysis tools with step-by-step instructions and code and details our recommendations for interpreting, reporting and archiving.},

abstract = {The paradigm-changing opportunities of biologging sensors for ecological research, especially movement ecology, are vast, but the crucial questions of how best to match the most appropriate sensors and sensor combinations to specific biological questions and how to analyse complex biologging data, are mostly ignored. Here, we fill this gap by reviewing how to optimize the use of biologging techniques to answer questions in movement ecology and synthesize this into an Integrated Biologging Framework (IBF). We highlight that multisensor approaches are a new frontier in biologging, while identifying current limitations and avenues for future development in sensor technology. We focus on the importance of efficient data exploration, and more advanced multidimensional visualization methods, combined with appropriate archiving and sharing approaches, to tackle the big data issues presented by biologging. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities in matching the peculiarities of specific sensor data to the statistical models used, highlighting at the same time the large advances which will be required in the latter to properly analyse biologging data. Taking advantage of the biologging revolution will require a large improvement in the theoretical and mathematical foundations of movement ecology, to include the rich set of high-frequency multivariate data, which greatly expand the fundamentally limited and coarse data that could be collected using location-only technology such as GPS. Equally important will be the establishment of multidisciplinary collaborations to catalyse the opportunities offered by current and future biologging technology. If this is achieved, clear potential exists for developing a vastly improved mechanistic understanding of animal movements and their roles in ecological processes and for building realistic predictive models.},

However, it is also sensitive and vulnerable to environmental changes due to high human populations and interactions between the land and ocean. Major threats of pollution from over enrichment of nutrients, increasing metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and climate change have led to severe ecological degradation in the coastal zone, while few studies have focused on the combined impacts of pollution and climate change on the coastal ecosystems at the global level. A global overview of nutrients, metals, POPs, and major environmental changes due to climate change and their impacts on coastal ecosystems was carried out in this study. Coasts of the Eastern Atlantic and Western Pacific were hotspots of concentrations of several pollutants, and mostly affected by warming climate. These hotspots shared the same features of large populations, heavy industry and (semi-) closed sea. Estimation of coastal ocean capital, integrated management of land-ocean interaction in the coastal zone, enhancement of integrated global observation system, and coastal ecosystem-based management can play effective roles in promoting sustainable management of coastal marine ecosystems. Enhanced management from the perspective of mitigating pollution and climate change was proposed.},

abstract = {How animal movement decisions interact with the distribution of resources to shape individual performance is a key question in ecology. However, links between spatial and behavioural ecology and fitness consequences are poorly understood because the outcomes of individual resource selection decisions, such as energy intake, are rarely measured. In the open ocean, mesoscale features (approx. 10–100 km) such as fronts and eddies can aggregate prey and thereby drive the distribution of foraging vertebrates through bottom-up biophysical coupling. These productive features are known to attract predators, yet their role in facilitating energy transfer to top-level consumers is opaque. We investigated the use of mesoscale features by migrating northern elephant seals and quantified the corresponding energetic gains from the seals' foraging patterns at a daily resolution. Migrating elephant seals modified their diving behaviour and selected for mesoscale features when foraging. Daily energy gain increased significantly with increasing mesoscale activity, indicating that the physical environment can influence predator fitness at fine temporal scales. Results show that areas of high mesoscale activity not only attract top predators as foraging hotspots, but also lead to increased energy transfer across trophic levels. Our study provides evidence that the physical environment is an important factor in controlling energy flow to top predators by setting the stage for variation in resource availability. Such understanding is critical for assessing how changes in the environment and resource distribution will affect individual fitness and food web dynamics.},

The expansion of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) has been advanced as a potential solution to this problem but their economic feasibility has hardly been studied. We conduct an economic assessment of the costs and benefits of six scenarios for the global expansion of MPAs. The analysis is conducted at a high spatial resolution, allowing the estimated costs and benefits to reflect the ecological and economic characteristics and context of each MPA and marine ecosystem. The results show that the global benefits of expanding MPAs exceed their costs by a factor 1.4–2.7 depending on the location and extent of MPA expansion. Targeting protection towards pristine areas with high biodiversity yields higher net returns than focusing on areas with low biodiversity or areas that have experienced high human impact.},

abstract = {Robust evidence exists that certain extreme weather and climate events, especially daily temperature and precipitation extremes, have changed in regard to intensity and frequency over recent decades. These changes have been linked to human-induced climate change, while the degree to which climate change impacts an individual extreme climate event (ECE) is more difficult to quantify. Rapid progress in event attribution has recently been made through improved understanding of observed and simulated climate variability, methods for event attribution and advances in numerical modelling. Attribution for extreme temperature events is stronger compared with other event types, notably those related to the hydrological cycle. Recent advances in the understanding of ECEs, both in observations and their representation in state-of-the-art climate models, open new opportunities for assessing their effect on human and natural systems. Improved spatial resolution in global climate models and advances in statistical and dynamical downscaling now provide climatic information at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Together with the continued development of Earth System Models that simulate biogeochemical cycles and interactions with the biosphere at increasing complexity, these make it possible to develop a mechanistic understanding of how ECEs affect biological processes, ecosystem functioning and adaptation capabilities. Limitations in the observational network, both for physical climate system parameters and even more so for long-term ecological monitoring, have hampered progress in understanding bio-physical interactions across a range of scales. New opportunities for assessing how ECEs modulate ecosystem structure and functioning arise from better scientific understanding of ECEs coupled with technological advances in observing systems and instrumentation.

Despite the fact that knowledge about the status of sea turtles at foraging grounds is a key element for developing the effective conservation strategies, comprehensive studies of hawksbills at foraging habitats in the eastern Pacific remain lacking. For many years anecdotal information indicated Coiba Island National Park in Panama as a potentially important hawksbill foraging ground, which led to the initiation of monitoring surveys in September 2014. Ongoing mark-recapture surveys to assess population status, generate demographic data and identify key foraging sites have been conducted every six months in the park since that time. To date, a total of six monitoring campaigns consisting of four days each have been conducted, leading to the capture and tagging of 186 hawksbills, 51 of which were recaptured at least once. The size range of captured individuals was 30.0 to 75.5 cm and largely comprised of juveniles. Somatic growth rates of individual hawksbills were highly variable, ranging from −0.78 to 7.1 cm year−1. To our knowledge, these are the first published growth rates for juvenile hawksbill turtles in the eastern Pacific Ocean. When these growth data are combined with information on hawksbill demography and distribution, our findings indicate Coiba Island National Park is one of the most important known foraging sites for hawksbill sea turtles in the eastern Pacific Ocean.},

abstract = {Prior to 2008 and the discovery of several important hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) nesting colonies in the EP (Eastern Pacific), the species was considered virtually absent from the region. Research since that time has yielded new insights into EP hawksbills, salient among them being the use of mangrove estuaries for nesting. These recent revelations have raised interest in the genetic characterization of hawksbills in the EP, studies of which have remained lacking to date. Between 2008 and 2014, we collected tissue samples from 269 nesting hawksbills at nine rookeries across the EP and used mitochondrial DNA sequences (766 bp) to generate the first genetic characterization of rookeries in the region. Our results inform genetic diversity, population differentiation, and phylogeography of the species. Hawksbills in the EP demonstrate low genetic diversity: We identified a total of only seven haplotypes across the region, including five new and two previously identified nesting haplotypes (pooled frequencies of 58.4{\%} and 41.6{\%}, respectively), the former only evident in Central American rookeries. Despite low genetic diversity, we found strong stock structure between the four principal rookeries, suggesting the existence of multiple populations and warranting their recognition as distinct management units. Furthermore, haplotypes EiIP106 and EiIP108 are unique to hawksbills that nest in mangrove estuaries, a behavior found only in hawksbills along Pacific Central America. The detected genetic differentiation supports the existence of a novel mangrove estuary "reproductive ecotype" that may warrant additional conservation attention. From a phylogeographic perspective, our research indicates hawksbills colonized the EP via the Indo-Pacific, and do not represent relict populations isolated from the Atlantic by the rising of the Panama Isthmus. Low overall genetic diversity in the EP is likely the combined result of few rookeries, extremely small reproductive populations and evolutionarily recent colonization events. Additional research with larger sample sizes and variable markers will help further genetic understanding of hawksbill turtles in the EP.},

abstract = {Prior to 2007, efforts to monitor and conserve hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) in the eastern Pacific Ocean were opportunistic and records were virtually non-existent. The first abundance estimates were published in 2010, but contained limited data on the species. Ongoing research since that time has led to the identification of several rookeries, including sites containing large proportions of the overall hawksbill nesting currently known to occur in the region. Monitoring projects were established at several sites and have since provided substantial nesting data on the species. Here we summarize data collected between 1983 and March 2016 from all sites (n = 9) confirmed to host {\textgreater}10 nests in any given season to provide an update on hawksbill nesting in the eastern Pacific. We documented a total of 3,508 hawksbill nests, 265,024 hatchlings and 528 individual nesting females in the region. The vast majority of these records (99.4{\%}, 99.9{\%} and 99.6{\%}, respectively) were generated subsequent to 2007, coinciding with the discovery of eight of the nine rookeries included in this study and the organization of monitoring efforts at those sites, which led to the increased documentation conferred here. Our findings should not be misconstrued as increases in actual nesting or signs of recovery, which could diminish the ongoing need for conservation actions, but rather as optimism, that there is still an opportunity to restore the species in the eastern Pacific. The top three sites in terms of average annual number of nests were Estero Padre Ramos (Nicaragua; 213.2 ± 47.6 nests), Bahia de Jiquilisco (El Salvador; 168.5 ± 46.7 nests) and Aserradores (Nicaragua; 100.0 ± 24.0 nests), and all three sites are located in mangrove estuaries in Central America, highlighting the importance of these rookeries/habitats for the survival and recovery of hawksbills in the region. The remaining six sites received between 6.9 ± 7.3 nests (Costa Careyes, Mexico) and 59.3 ± 17.7 nests (Los Cobanos, El Salvador) annually. By integrating data collected on nesting hawksbills with local conservation realities at the most important known hawksbill rookeries in the eastern Pacific, we provide a more holistic view of the conservation status and management needs of the species in this ocean region.},

abstract = {The loggerhead sea turtle is an endangered species exposed to many anthropogenic hazards in the Pacific. It is widely held that pelagic longline fisheries pose the major risk for Pacific loggerheads but the effects of other risk factors such as human-induced global climate change have rarely been considered. So we used generalised additive regression modelling and autoregressive-prewhitened cross-correlation analysis to explore whether regional ocean temperatures affect the long-term nesting population dynamics for the 2 Pacific loggerhead genetic stocks (Japan, Australia). We found that both Pacific stocks have been exposed to slowly increasing trends in mean annual sea surface temperature in their respective core regional foraging habitats over the past 50 years. We show that irrespective of whether a population was decreasing or increasing that there was an inverse correlation between nesting abundance and mean annual sea surface temperature in the core foraging region during the year prior to the summer nesting season. Cooler foraging habitat ocean temperatures are presumably associated with increased ocean productivity and prey abundance and consequently increased loggerhead breeding capacity. So warming regional ocean temperatures could lead to long-term decreased food supply and reduced nesting and recruitment unless Pacific loggerheads adapt by shifting their foraging habitat to cooler regions. So the gradual warming of the Pacific Ocean over the past 50 years is a major risk factor that must be considered in any meaningful diagnosis of the long-term declines apparent for some Pacific loggerhead nesting populations.},

abstract = {1. The paradigm-changing opportunities of bio-logging sensors for ecological research, especially movement ecology, are vast, but the crucial questions of how best to match the most appropriate sensors and sensor combinations to specific biological questions, and how to analyse complex bio-logging data, are mostly ignored. 2. Here, we fill this gap by reviewing how to optimise the use of bio-logging techniques to answer questions in movement ecology and synthesise this into an Integrated Bio-logging Framework (IBF). 3. We highlight that multi-sensor approaches are a new frontier in bio-logging, whilst identifying current limitations and avenues for future development in sensor technology.4. We focus on the importance of efficient data exploration, and more advanced multi-dimensional visualisation methods, combined with appropriate archiving and sharing approaches, to tackle the big data issues presented by bio-logging. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities in matching the peculiarities of specific sensor data to the statistical models used, highlighting at the same time the large advances which will be required in the latter to properly analyse bio-logging data. 5. Taking advantage of the bio-logging revolution will require a large improvement in the theoretical and mathematical foundations of movement ecology, to include the rich set of high-frequency multivariate data, which greatly expand the fundamentally limited and coarse data that could be collected using location-only technology such as GPS. Equally important will be the establishment of multi-disciplinary collaborations to catalyse the opportunities offered by current and future bio-logging technology. If this is achieved, clear potential exists for developing a vastly improved mechanistic understanding of animal movements and their roles in ecological processes, and for building realistic predictive models.},

abstract = {The early life of animals is a period of high mortality, when foraging capacities are assumed to be improved progressively. In birds, this critical period involves the improvement of the flight. How do young birds gain these capacities has rarely been studied in natural conditions especially in seabirds that spend most of their life at sea. We used detailed GPS and body acceleration data on 37 great frigatebirds (Fregata minor), to test the hypothesis that juveniles starting their first flights have lower flying capacities than adults, but that these capacities will improve during a long learning period, before independence from parents, specific to this seabird that can spend months on the wing at sea. We found that most flight components improved over time to tend towards those of adults, especially the travel speed, range, duration and maximum altitude of trips. However, unexpectedly, juveniles had higher ascent rates, soaring and gliding capacities above the sea than adults. Moreover, energy expenditure of juveniles was similar to adults during low cost travelling movements and during active foraging, but juveniles spent more time foraging actively than adults. Our results suggest that flight tactics based on long-distance effortless movements specific to this family are acquired during a long period, but soaring and gliding capacities are already inherited by juveniles and possibly favoured by morphological adaptations specific to juveniles. These adaptations might explain the extreme dispersive capacities of juveniles.},

abstract = {Background: Biotelemetry has become a key tool for studying marine animals in the last decade, and a wide range of electronic tags are now available for answering a range of research questions. However, comparatively, less attention has been given to attachment methods for these tags and the implications of tag retention on study design, especially when designing a comparative study looking at multiple species. Here, we reported our findings on acoustic tag retention rates for juveniles of two species of marine turtle: the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) and the hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata). We captured both species twice annually (spring and fall) from 2012 through 2017, as part of a capture-mark-recapture study at Buck Island Reef National Monument, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. We assessed tag retention rates using physical recaptures of turtles previously outfitted with an acoustic tag. Results: We deployed 72 acoustic tags on 60 juvenile greens and 37 acoustic tags on 29 hawksbills. We estimated the half-life for tags on greens to be 150 days (95{\%} CI 117-188 days), whereas the half-life for tags on hawksbills was 1077 days (95{\%} CI 870-2118 days), a marked difference. We observed that tag attachment holes, drilled into the posterior marginal scutes, migrated laterally towards the outer edge of the marginals in both species. Green turtles tended to exhibit tear-outs, as their attachment holes wore and/or tags grew near the edge of their scutes, whereas hawksbills tended to maintain the structure of these holes and did not exhibit these tear-outs. Conclusions: We conclude that hawksbills can be tagged with long-battery-life acoustic tags for long-term studies of habitat use and movement patterns, whereas greens are likely to shed their tags in the 1st year, making long-term studies difficult. This study is the first clear evidence that tagging protocols should vary between species of hard-shelled turtles. Furthermore, shed tags on the seafloor continue to be detected by acoustic receivers, creating a challenge in data filtering before analysis. We encourage future research into an efficient method for filtering these data points prior to analysis.},

abstract = {Long-term bio-logging has the potential to reveal how movements, and hence life-history trade-offs, vary over a lifetime. Reproductive tactics in particular may vary as individuals' trade-off current investment versus lifetime fitness. Male African savanna elephants (Loxodona africana) provide a telling example of balancing body growth with reproductive fitness due to the combination of indeterminate growth and strongly delineated periods of sexual activity (musth), which results in reproductive tactics that alter with age. Our study aims to quantify the extent to which male elephants alter their movement patterns, and hence energetic allocation, in relation to (a) reproductive state and (b) age, and (c) to determine whether musth periods can be detected directly from GPS tracking data. We used a combination of GPS tracking data and visual observations of 25 male elephants ranging in age from 20 to 52 years to examine the influence of reproductive state and age on movement. We then used a three-state hidden Markov model (HMM) to detect musth behaviour in a subset of sequential tracking data. Our results demonstrate that male elephants increased their daily mean speed and range size with age and in musth. Furthermore, non-musth speed decreased with age, presumably reflecting a shift towards energy acquisition during non-musth. Thus, despite similar speeds and marginally larger ranges between reproductive states at age 20, by age 50, males were travelling 2.0 times faster in a 3.5 times larger area in musth relative to non-musth. The distinctiveness of musth periods over age 35 meant the three-state HMM could automatically detect musth movement with high sensitivity and specificity, but could not for the younger age class. We show that male elephants increased their energetic allocation into reproduction with age as the probability of reproductive success increases. Given that older male elephants tend to be both the target of legal trophy hunting and illegal poaching, man-made interference could drive fundamental changes in elephant reproductive tactics. Bio-logging, as our study reveals, has the potential both to quantify mature elephant reproductive tactics remotely and to be used to institute proactive management strategies around the reproductive behaviour of this charismatic keystone species.},

abstract = {Blue whales Balaenoptera musculus meet the highest prey demands of any predator that has ever existed by feeding exclusively upon dense but patchy schools of pelagic euphausiids. We examined the role that seasonally high primary production supported by coastal upwelling combined with topographic breaks off California play in creating, collecting, and maintaining euphausiids at densities sufficient to allow exploitation by whales. We used concurrent ship- and mooring-based oceanographic, hydroacoustic, and net sampling, whale-sighting records, visual surveys, and time-depth recorder deployment to examine temporal and spatial linkages between (1) intensity of upwelling, (2) primary production, (3) development, density and distribution of euphausiids, and (4) the distribution, abundance, and foraging behavior of blue whales in Monterey Bay, California between 1992 and 1996. Blue whales fed exclusively upon adult euphausiids Thysanoessa spinifera and Euphausia pacifica that were larger than those generally available in the Bay. Foraging whales dove repeatedly to dense euphausiid aggregations between 150 and 200 m on the edge of the Monterey Bay Submarine Canyon. Euphausiid aggregations where whales were foraging averaged 153 g m-3, approximately 2 orders of magnitude greater than mean euphausiid densities in the Bay (1.3 g m-3). High euphausiid densities are supported by high primary production between April and August (249 mgC m-3 d-1) and a submarine canyon that provides deep water down-current from an upwelling region. Peak euphausiid densities occur in late summer/early fall, lagging the seasonal increase in primary production by 3 to 4 mo. This lag results from the temporal development of euphausiids spawned around the spring increase in primary production and the shoreward collapse of productivity due to decreased upwelling in late summer. The migratory movements of the California blue whale probably reflect seasonal patterns in productivity in other foraging areas similar to those we describe for Monterey Bay. {\textcopyright}Inter-Research 2005.},

This is especially true along the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, where 99{\%} of the country's mangroves occur. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), or drones, have become a convenient tool for natural area assessment, and offer a solution to the problems of remote mangrove monitoring. This study is the first to use UAS to analyze the structure of a mangrove forests within Central America. Our goals were to (1) determine the forest structure of two estuaries in northwestern Costa Rica through traditional ground measurements, (2) assess the accuracy of UAS measurements of canopy height and percent coverage and (3) determine whether the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) could discriminate between the most abundant mangrove species. We flew a UAS equipped with a single NDVI sensor during the peak wet (Sept–Nov) and dry (Jan–Feb) seasons. The structure and species composition of the estuaries showed a possible transition between the wet mangroves of southern Costa Rica and the drier northern mangroves. UAS-derived measurements at 100 cm/pixel resolution of percent canopy coverage and maximum and mean canopy height were not statistically different from ground measurements (p {\textgreater} 0.05). However, there were differences in mean canopy height at 10 cm/pixel resolution (p = 0.043), indicating diminished returns in accuracy as resolution becomes extremely fine. Mean NDVI values of Avicennia germinans (most abundant species) changed significantly between seasons (p {\textless} 0.001). Mean NDVI of Rhizophora racemosa (second most abundant species) was significantly different from A. germinans and dry forest dominant plots during the dry season (p {\textless} 0.001), demonstrating NDVI's capability of discriminating mangrove species. This study provides the first structural assessment of the studied estuaries and a framework for future studies of mangroves using UAS.},

abstract = {The extent to which prey space use actively minimizes predation risk continues to ignite controversy. Methodological reasons that have hindered consensus include inconsistent measurements of predation risk, biased spatiotemporal scales at which responses are measured and lack of robust null expectations. We addressed all three challenges in a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal responses of adult female elk (Cervus elaphus) to the risk of predation by wolves (Canis lupus) during winter in northern Yellowstone, USA. We quantified spatial overlap between the winter home ranges of GPS-collared elk and three measures of predation risk: the intensity of wolf space use, the distribution of wolf-killed elk and vegetation openness. We also assessed whether elk varied their use of areas characterized by more or less predation risk across hours of the day, and estimated encounter rates between simultaneous elk and wolf pack trajectories. We determined whether observed values were significantly lower than expected if elk movements were random with reference to predation risk using a null model approach. Although a small proportion of elk did show a tendency to minimize use of open vegetation at specific times of the day, overall we highlight a notable absence of spatiotemporal response by female elk to the risk of predation posed by wolves in northern Yellowstone. Our results suggest that predator–prey interactions may not always result in strong spatiotemporal patterns of avoidance.},

abstract = {Acoustic telemetry is a popular tool for long-term tracking of aquatic animals to describe and quantify patterns of movement, space use, and diverse ecological interactions. Acoustic receivers are imperfect sampling instruments, and their detection range (DR; the area surrounding the receiver in which tag transmissions can be detected) often varies dramatically over space and time due to dynamic environmental conditions. Therefore, it is prudent to quantify and account for variation in DR to prevent telemetry system performance from confounding the understanding of real patterns in animal space use. However, acoustic receiver DR consists of a complex, dynamic, three-dimensional area that is challenging to quantify. Although quantifying the absolute DR of all receivers is infeasible in the context of most acoustic telemetry studies, we outline a practical approach to quantify relative variation among receiver DR over space and time. This approach involves selecting a set of sentinel receivers to monitor drivers of variation in detection range. Each sentinel receiver is subject to a range testing procedure to estimate detection efficiency (DE; the proportion of total transmissions detected by the receiver), at a range of distances from the receiver, to derive the maximum range (MR; distance from the receiver where DE is 5{\%}) and Midpoint (distance from the receiver where DE is 50{\%}). A reference transmitter is then placed at the Midpoint, providing a standardized measure of long-term variation in DE, with each station having similar freedom of variance. Variation in reference tag DE is then combined with MR to calculate a DR correction factor (DRc). A modelling approach is then used to estimate DRc for all receivers in the array at spatial and temporal scales of ecological interest, which can be used to correct animal detection data in various ways. We demonstrate this method with a hypothetical dataset, as well as empirical data from an acoustic telemetry array to delineate spatio-temporal patterns of fish habitat use. This is a flexible and practical approach to account for variation in acoustic receiver performance, allowing more accurate spatial and temporal patterns in aquatic animal spatial ecology to be revealed.},

Key areas highlighted include (1) objectively identifying oceanic hotspots; (2) measuring what animals are actually doing in different parts of their range (e.g. foraging) rather than simply inferring their state from their position and movement; (3) completing energy budgets for species over ecologically relevant timescales (e.g. the period between breeding seasons); (4) using biological information to help drive conservation management; and (5) assessing the impact of climate change. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier B.V.

In myoglobin, this reaction is thought to proceed through an iron(III)-bound peroxynitrite before homolytic cleavage of the O-O bond to form an iron(IV)-oxo and NO(2) radical followed by recombination and nitrate production. Single turnover experiments at alkaline pH have revealed the presence of a millisecond high-spin heme intermediate. It is widely presumed that this species is an iron(III)-peroxynitrite species, but detailed characterization of the intermediate is lacking. Using resonance Raman spectroscopy and rapid-freeze quench techniques, we identify the millisecond intermediate as an iron(III)-nitrato complex with a symmetric NO(2) stretch at 1282 cm(-1). Greater time resolution techniques will be required to detect the putative iron(III) peroxynitrite complex.},

abstract = {– Recent evidence suggests that higher sea-surface temperatures are affecting nesting patterns in loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta), specifically by causing nesting to begin earlier in years with higher oceanic temperatures. I tested whether a sympatrically nesting species (Chelonia mydas) also shows the same pattern and found that green turtle seasonal nesting patterns at Canaveral National Seashore, Florida, were unrelated to environmental temperatures at the nesting beach; although, the date of the first nest predicted the magnitude of the nesting season (nesting earlier in the year led to higher numbers of nests). Although the reasons for differences in loggerhead and green turtles remain unclear, these results indicate that the timing of loggerhead turtle nesting may change in a warming environment; whereas, green turtle nesting may remain relatively fixed with regard to temperatures at the nesting beach.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {The extent to which prey space use actively minimizes predation risk continues to ignite controversy. Methodological reasons that have hindered consensus include inconsistent measurements of predation risk, biased spatiotemporal scales at which responses are measured and lack of robust null expectations. We addressed all three challenges in a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal responses of adult female elk (Cervus elaphus) to the risk of predation by wolves (Canis lupus) during winter in northern Yellowstone, USA. We quantified spatial overlap between the winter home ranges of GPS-collared elk and three measures of predation risk: the intensity of wolf space use, the distribution of wolf-killed elk and vegetation openness. We also assessed whether elk varied their use of areas characterized by more or less predation risk across hours of the day, and estimated encounter rates between simultaneous elk and wolf pack trajectories. We determined whether observed values were significantly lower than expected if elk movements were random with reference to predation risk using a null model approach. Although a small proportion of elk did show a tendency to minimize use of open vegetation at specific times of the day, overall we highlight a notable absence of spatiotemporal response by female elk to the risk of predation posed by wolves in northern Yellowstone. Our results suggest that predator–prey interactions may not always result in strong spatiotemporal patterns of avoidance.},

Discrete-time hidden Markov models (HMMs) achieve considerable computational gains by focusing on observations that are regularly spaced in time, and for which the measurement error is negligible. These conditions are often met, in particular for data related to terrestrial animals, so that a likelihood-based HMM approach is feasible. We describe a number of extensions of HMMs for animal movement modeling, including more flexible state transition models and individual random effects (fitted in a non-Bayesian framework). In particular we consider so-called hidden semi-Markov models, which may substantially improve the goodness of fit and provide important insights into the behavioral state switching dynamics. To showcase the expediency of these methods, we consider an application of a hierarchical hidden semi-Markov model to multiple bison movement paths. {\textcopyright}2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Background: Accelerometers are powerful sensors in many bio-logging devices, and are increasingly allowing researchers to investigate the performance, behaviour, energy expenditure and even state, of free-living animals. Another sensor commonly used in animal-attached loggers is the magnetometer, which has been primarily used in dead-reckoning or inertial measurement tags, but little outside that. We examine the potential of magnetometers for helping elucidate the behaviour of animals in a manner analogous to, but very different from, accelerometers. The particular responses of magnetometers to movement means that there are instances when they can resolve behaviours that are not easily perceived using accelerometers. Methods: We calibrated the tri-axial magnetometer to rotations in each axis of movement and constructed 3- dimensional plots to inspect these stylised movements. Using the tri-axial data of Daily Diary tags, attached to individuals of number of animal species as they perform different behaviours, we used these 3-d plots to develop a framework with which tri-axial magnetometry data can be examined and introduce metrics that should help quantify movement and behaviour. Results: Tri-axial magnetometry data reveal patterns in movement at various scales of rotation that are not always evident in acceleration data. Some of these patterns may be obscure until visualised in 3D space as tri-axial spherical plots (m-spheres). A tag-fitted animal that rotates in heading while adopting a constant body attitude produces a ring of data around the pole of the m-sphere that we define as its Normal Operational Plane (NOP). Data that do not lie on this ring are created by postural rotations of the animal as it pitches and/or rolls. Consequently, stereotyped behaviours appear as specific trajectories on the sphere (m-prints), reflecting conserved sequences of postural changes (and/or angular velocities), which result from the precise relationship between body attitude and heading. This novel approach shows promise for helping researchers to identify and quantify behaviours in terms of animal body posture, including heading. Conclusion: Magnetometer-based techniques and metrics can enhance our capacity to identify and examine animal behaviour, either as a technique used alone, or one that is complementary to tri-axial accelerometry.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Sea turtles are migratory animals that travel from foraging grounds to specific nesting beaches every few years and that, therefore, can be influenced by oceanographic conditions in several different habitats. We assessed how sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-$\alpha$ (Chl-$\alpha$) within both internesting and foraging areas influence the nesting abundance, phenology and duration of internesting periods of the green turtles (Chelonia mydas) that nest at Cabuyal, Northwest Costa Rica. Specifically, we compared (1) SST and Chl-$\alpha$ in foraging areas to the nesting abundance and median nesting date (MND) registered on the beach over seven nesting seasons and (2) SST in internesting habitats to the observed internesting period (OIP) (number of days between successful nesting events) and the MND. Nesting abundance was strongly correlated to Chl-$\alpha$ concentrations at the main foraging area during the February preceding the nesting season. However, we found no significant effect of SST or Chl-$\alpha$ in either foraging or internesting habitats on the MND. Mean SST values in the internesting habitats and OIP were negatively correlated and were highly variable both between and within years. Oceanographic conditions appear to strongly influence OIP and nesting abundance, but not the nesting phenology of green turtles in this area. The complex nature of the effect of oceanographic conditions on reproduction of the East Pacific green turtle suggests uncertainty in how this species will respond to climate change.},

abstract = {Top pelagic predators such as tunas, sharks, marine turtles and mammals have historically been difficult to study due to their large body size and vast range over the oceanic habitat. In recent years the development of small microprocessor-based data storage tags that are surgically implanted or satellite-linked provide marine researchers a novel avenue for examining the movements, physiology and behaviors of pelagic animals in the wild. When biological and physical data obtained from the tags are combined with satellite derived sea surface temperature and ocean color data, the relationships between the movements, behaviors and physical ocean environment can be examined. Tag-bearing marine animals can function as autonomous ocean profilers providing oceanographic data wherever their long migrations take them. The biologging science is providing ecological physiologists with new insights into the seasonal movements, habitat utilization, breeding behaviors and population structures in of marine vertebrates. In addition, the data are revealing migration corridors, hot spots and physical oceanographic patterns that are key to understanding how organisms such as bluefin tunas use the open ocean environment. In the 21st century as ecosystem degradation and global warming continue to threaten the existence of species on Earth, the field of physiological ecology will play a more pivotal role in conservation biology.},

abstract = {Recent increases in global temperatures have affected the phenology and survival of many species of plants and animals. We investigated a case study of the effects of potential climate change on a thermally sensitive species, the loggerhead sea turtle, at a breeding location at the northerly extent of the range of regular nesting in the United States. In addition to the physical limits imposed by temperature on this ectothermic species, sea turtle primary sex ratio is determined by the temperature experienced by eggs during the middle third of incubation. We recorded sand temperatures and used historical air temperatures (ATs) at Bald Head Island, NC, to examine past and predict future sex ratios under scenarios of warming. There were no significant temporal trends in primary sex ratio evident in recent years and estimated mean annual sex ratio was 58{\%} female. Similarly, there were no temporal trends in phenology but earlier nesting and longer nesting seasons were correlated with warmer sea surface temperature. We modelled the effects of incremental increases in mean AT of up to 7.5 1C, the maximum predicted increase under modelled scenarios, which would lead to 100{\%} female hatchling production and lethally high incubation temperatures, causing reduction in hatchling production. Populations of turtles in more southern parts of the United States are currently highly female biased and are likely to become ultra-biased with as little as 1 1C of warming and experience extreme levels of mortality if warming exceeds 3 1C. The lack of a demonstrable increase in AT in North Carolina in recent decades coupled with primary sex ratios that are not highly biased means that the male offspring from North Carolina could play an increasingly important role in the future viability of the loggerhead turtle in the Western Atlantic.},

abstract = {Accelerometry is growing in popularity for remotely measuring fish swimming metrics, but appropriate sampling frequencies for accurately measuring these metrics are not well studied. This research examined the influence of sampling frequency (1–25 Hz) with tri-axial accelerometer biologgers on estimates of overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), tail-beat frequency, swimming speed and metabolic rate of bonefish Albula vulpes in a swim-tunnel respirometer and free-swimming in a wetland mesocosm. In the swim tunnel, sampling frequencies of ≥ 5 Hz were sufficient to establish strong relationships between ODBA, swimming speed and metabolic rate. However, in free-swimming bonefish, estimates of metabolic rate were more variable below 10 Hz. Sampling frequencies should be at least twice the maximum tail-beat frequency to estimate this metric effectively, which is generally higher than those required to estimate ODBA, swimming speed and metabolic rate. While optimal sampling frequency probably varies among species due to tail-beat frequency and swimming style, this study provides a reference point with a medium body-sized sub-carangiform teleost fish, enabling researchers to measure these metrics effectively and maximize study duration.},

abstract = {The evolution and improvement of novel applications on acoustic telemetry technology are driven mainly by the need to address more complex behavioral, ecological and physiological questions. A new Vemco VR2W Positioning System (VPS) is described and tested here using an array of 16 VR2W acoustic monitoring receivers and 8 fixed synchronizing transmitters. VPS positioning algorithm is based on the 3-receiver time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) algorithm used by the existing Vemco VRAP system, extended to work with an array of three or more receivers that do not have synchronized clocks. The positional accuracy and performance of the VPS was estimated on a stationary and a slow-moving coded transmitter, and on two free-swimming elasmobranch species. Mean positional accuracy (±SD) of VPS estimates from a stationary transmitter deployed at several locations within the receiver array was 2.64 ± 2.32. m. Positional error was significantly lower inside (2.13 ± 1.31. m) than outside the array (5.12 ± 4.11. m; p{\textless} 0001). There were no significant differences in positional accuracy between stationary and moving tests (4.09 ± 2.53. m; p= 0.067). Furthermore, home range estimates and movement parameters of two elasmobranch species tracked simultaneously with VPS and active tracking were statistically similar (p{\textgreater} 0.05). Our results suggest that the positional accuracy of the VPS is comparable to active tracking; however, researchers must consider specific environmental and biological variables when using the VPS. Additionally, the number, layout and proximity of acoustic receivers and synchronizing transmitters can improve considerably the performance of the VPS. The VPS provides a more efficient, less expensive approach to study and quantify fine-scale, long-term movements and habitat use of multiple individuals simultaneously, with the potential for improving our understanding on ecological and behavioral population level processes in aquatic environments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Recent advances in biologging open promising perspectives in the study of animal movements at numerous scales. It is now possible to record time series of animal locations and ancillary data (e.g. activity level derived from on-board accelerometers) over extended areas and long durations with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Such time series are often piecewise stationary, as the animal may alternate between different stationary phases (i.e. characterized by a specific mean and variance of some key parameter for limited periods). Identifying when these phases start and end is a critical first step to understand the dynamics of the underlying movement processes. We introduce a new segmentation-clustering method we called segclust2d (available as a r package at cran.r-project.org/package=segclust2d). It can segment bivariate (or more generally multivariate) time series and possibly cluster the various segments obtained, corresponding to different phases assumed to be stationary. This method is easy to use, as it only requires specifying a minimum segment length (to prevent over-segmentation), based on biological rather than statistical considerations. This method can be applied to bivariate piecewise time series of any nature. We focus here on two types of time series related to animal movement, corresponding to (a) at large scale, series of bivariate coordinates of relocations, to highlight temporary home ranges, and (b) at smaller scale, bivariate series derived from relocations data, such as speed and turning angle, to highlight different behavioural modes such as transit, feeding and resting. Using computer simulations, we show that segclust2d can rival and even outperform previous, more complex methods, which were specifically developed to highlight changes of movement modes or home range shifts (based on hidden Markov and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck modelling), which, contrary to our method, usually require the user to provide relevant initial guesses to be efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate it on actual examples involving a zebra's small-scale movements and an elephant's large-scale movements, to illustrate how various movement modes and home range shifts, respectively, can be identified.},

abstract = {Satellite telemetry has helped reveal migratory movements of sea turtles. We attached satellite transmitters (MK10 Pat Tags) to 10 post-nesting East Pacific green turtles Chelonia mydas from Nombre de Jes{\'{u}}s, Costa Rica (in 2006, 2007 and 2009) to track their movements, identify their foraging grounds, and elucidate their foraging behavior. Location data were analyzed by applying a switching state-space model to obtain daily position estimates and to differentiate between 2 behavioral modes (migrating and foraging). All post-nesting movements were along coastal routes ranging up to 1086 km from the nesting beach. Of the 10 turtles, 6 remained local residents of Costa Rica foraging in the Gulf of Papagayo (N = 2) and the Gulf of Santa Elena (N = 4). One individual moved southwards to the Gulf of Panama, and 3 other turtles migrated northwards to waters off the Gulf of Fonseca in northern Nicaragua, with one continuing its foraging movements northwards to coastal Guatemala. Home ranges during foraging varied widely among individuals, and the calculated size of feeding grounds ranged from 315 to 18 335 km2, the latter being the largest reported for this species. The fact that members of this nesting population inhabit coastal waters makes them vulnerable to human activities along the coasts of Central America. Our findings highlight the importance of Costa Rica and the coastal waters of Central America for the survival of the Endangered Costa Rican green turtles. {\textcopyright}Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract = {A combination of climatic and environmental factors influences, and potentially guides, certain life-history processes, such as breeding. Sea turtle females may wait offshore for the optimal conditions to nest, but these environmental cues remain mostly unknown. Our aim was to identify climatic and tidal influences on nesting for leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) and try to find any specific conditions that induced them to abort the nesting attempt. To assess these issues, the beach in Pacuare Nature Reserve, on the Caribbean Costa Rica, was monitored from 2010 to 2015. Models showed that high atmospheric pressure and wind speed favoured nesting but high rainfall discouraged successful nesting; high and low tides were negatively correlated with nesting, suggesting that turtles avoid nesting when tidal cycles reach their extremes. Overall, climatic features likely related to storm episodes, and extreme tidal ranges, appear to influence leatherbacks' nesting behaviour. Therefore, the steady increase in intense storm occurrence predicted by climatic projections might represent an additional obstacle to the survival of this species.},

In order to do this we combined published data from existing flipper tagging and early satellite tracking studies with data from an additional 12 satellite tracked green turtles (1996-2006). Three of these were tracked from their foraging grounds in the Gulf of California along the east coast of the Baja California peninsula to their breeding grounds in Michoac{\'{a}}n (1337-2928 km). In addition, three post-nesting females were satellite tracked from Colola beach, Michoac{\'{a}}n to their foraging grounds in southern Mexico and Central America (941.3-3020 km). A further six turtles were tracked in the Gulf of California within their foraging grounds giving insights into the scale of ranging behaviour. Turtles undertaking long-distance migrations showed a tendency to follow the coastline. Turtles tracked within foraging grounds showed that foraging individuals typically ranged up to 691.6 km (maximum) from release site location. Additionally, we carried out threat analysis (using the cumulative global human impact in the Eastern Pacific) clustering pre-existing satellite tracking studies from Galapagos, Costa Rica, and data obtained from this study; this indicated that turtles foraging and nesting in Central American waters are subject to the highest anthropogenic impact. Considering that turtles from all three rookeries were found to migrate towards Central America, it is highly important to implement conservation plans in Central American coastal areas to ensure the survival of the remaining green turtles in the Eastern Pacific. Finally, by combining satellite tracking data from this and previous studies, and data of tag returns we created the best available distributional patterns for this particular sea turtle species, which emphasized that conservation measures in key areas may have positive consequences on a regional scale.},

abstract = {The timing and strength of wind-driven coastal upwelling along the eastern margins of major ocean basins regulate the productivity of critical fisheries and marine ecosystems by bringing deep and nutrient-rich waters to the sunlit surface, where photosynthesis can occur. How coastal upwelling regimes might change in a warming climate is therefore a question of vital importance. Although enhanced land-ocean differential heating due to greenhouse warming has been proposed to intensify coastal upwelling by strengthening alongshore winds, analyses of observations and previous climate models have provided little consensus on historical and projected trends in coastal upwelling. Here we show that there are strong and consistent changes in the timing, intensity and spatial heterogeneity of coastal upwelling in response to future warming in most Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUSs). An ensemble of climate models shows that by the end of the twenty-first century the upwelling season will start earlier, end later and become more intense at high but not low latitudes. This projected increase in upwelling intensity and duration at high latitudes will result in a substantial reduction of the existing latitudinal variation in coastal upwelling. These patterns are consistent across three of the four EBUSs (Canary, Benguela and Humboldt, but not California). The lack of upwelling intensification and greater uncertainty associated with the California EBUS may reflect regional controls associated with the atmospheric response to climate change. Given the strong linkages between upwelling and marine ecosystems, the projected changes in the intensity, timing and spatial structure of coastal upwelling may influence the geographical distribution of marine biodiversity.},

abstract = {We studied the oceanographic and meteorological conditions in four sites related to national parks in the {\'{A}}rea de Conservaci{\'{o}}n Guanacaste. Variables such as temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen were studied through the water column in at least one tidal cycle at three bays Tamarindo, Culebra, Santa Elena located in the North Pacific of Costa Rica, and in Ballena Bay, off the Gulf of Nicoya. At the same time, local wind and ocean currents were measured in order to evaluate the dynamic forces at these sites. Environmental variables around Costa Rica were consulted from operational data sources, such as ocean currents and surface wind patterns, to know the prevailing conditions and their influence. During strong trade winds, a typical dry season condition, strong ocean currents are generated in front of the Nicoya Peninsula. This is consistent with the prevailing oceanographic conditions offshore Papagayo Gulf when the wind jet is established. These external forces influence the ocean circulation of open water bays, as was observed in Tamarindo Bay. The local wind and tide are components that modulate local circulation, especially in closed bays like Santa Elena and Ballena. The stratified current structure of the water layers in Ballena Bay showed a typical estuarine condition with the presence of different thermohaline fields dominated by tidal forces.},

abstract = {Wind energy production has expanded to meet climate change mitigation goals, but negative impacts of wind turbines have been reported on wildlife. Soaring birds are among the most affected groups with alarming fatality rates by collision with wind turbines and an escalating occupation of their migratory corridors. These birds have been described as changing their flight trajectories to avoid wind turbines, but this behaviour may lead to functional habitat loss, as suitable soaring areas in the proximity of wind turbines will likely be underused. We modelled the displacement effect of wind turbines on black kites (Milvus migrans) tracked by GPS. We also evaluated the impact of this effect at the scale of the landscape by estimating how much suitable soaring area was lost to wind turbines. We used state-of-the-art tracking devices to monitor the movements of 130 black kites in an area populated by wind turbines, at the migratory bottleneck of the Strait of Gibraltar. Landscape use by birds was mapped from GPS data using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models, and generalized additive mixed modelling was used to estimate the effect of wind turbine proximity on bird use while accounting for orographic and thermal uplift availability. We found that areas up to approximately 674 m away from the turbines were less used than expected given their uplift potential. Within that distance threshold, bird use decreased with the proximity to wind turbines. We estimated that the footprint of wind turbines affected 3{\%}–14{\%} of the areas suitable for soaring in our study area. We present evidence that the impacts of wind energy industry on soaring birds are greater than previously acknowledged. In addition to the commonly reported fatalities, the avoidance of turbines by soaring birds causes habitat losses in their movement corridors. Authorities should recognize this further impact of wind energy production and establish new regulations that protect soaring habitat. We also showed that soaring habitat for birds can be modelled at a fine scale using publicly available data. Such an approach can be used to plan low-impact placement of turbines in new wind energy developments.},

abstract = {A new area of biological research is identifying and grouping patterns of behaviour in wild animals by analysing data obtained through the attachment of tri-axial accelerometers. As these recording devices become smaller and less expensive their use has increased. Currently acceleration data are visualised as 2D time series plots, and analyses are based on summary statistics and the application of Fourier transforms. We develop alternate visualisations of this data so as to analyse, explore and present new patterns of animal behaviour. Our visualisations include interactive spherical scatterplots, spherical histograms, clustering methods, and feature-based state diagrams of the data. We study the application of these visualisation methods to accelerometry data from animal movement. The reaction of biologists to these visualisations is also reported. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Shifting suitable range limits under global warming will threaten many species. Modeling and mapping these potential range shifts is important for conservation. As global warming will introduce new sets of abiotic conditions, predictive empirical niche models may not perform well and the best method to model a specie's projected range shifts may be to model their fundamental niche with a biophysical mechanistic niche model. However, this class of model requires many physiological parameters that are difficult to measure for species not easily kept in captivity. It is also difficult to estimate these parameters for marine species given the interactions among their in-water motion, metabolism, and heat transfer. To surmount these difficulties, we use our previously verified novel technique combining 3D digital design, computational fluid dynamics, and finite volume heat transfer modeling to find animal core temperatures. We then use this method to build a fundamental niche map for internesting and nesting leatherback sea turtles (. Dermochelys coriacea). With these niche maps we analyze three main nesting areas. We show that global warming poses a large overheating risk to leatherbacks in Southeast Asia, a slight risk to leatherbacks in the West Atlantic and a low risk to leatherbacks in the East Atlantic. We also show that the impact may be less on leatherbacks that shift their nesting location or who are smaller. Methods such these are important to produce efficiently and economically accurate maps of regions that will become inhospitable to species under global warming conditions.},

Rather, fishing has induced serial depletions, long masked by improved technology, geographic expansion and exploitation of previously spurned species lower in the food web. With global catches declining since the late 1980s, continuation of present trends will lead to supply shortfall, for which aquaculture cannot be expected to compensate, and may well exacerbate. Reducing fishing capacity to appropriate levels will require strong reductions of subsidies. Zoning the oceans into unfished marine reserves and areas with limited levels of fishing effort would allow sustainable fisheries, based on resources embedded in functional, diverse ecosystems.},

Here, we report new satellite tracking data on female hawksbills from several countries in the eastern Pacific that revealed previously undocumented behaviour for adults of the species. In contrast to patterns of habitat use exhibited by their Caribbean and Indo-Pacific counterparts, eastern Pacific hawksbills generally occupied inshore estuaries, wherein they had strong associations with mangrove saltwater forests. The use of inshore habitats and affinities with mangrove saltwater forests presents a previously unknown life-history paradigm for adult hawksbill turtles and suggests a potentially unique evolutionary trajectory for the species.

IACUCs may, however, lack the knowledge and experience to evaluate fish projects judiciously, especially when the projects are in field settings. Surgeries involving implantation of transmitters and other instruments into the coelom, which now comprise a very common research tool in the study of free-ranging fishes, are examples of surgeries that use a broad spectrum of surgical and anesthetic techniques, some of which would not be considered acceptable for similar work on mammals. IACUCs should apply the standards they would expect to be used for surgeries on homeotherms to surgeries on fish. Surgeons should be carefully trained and experienced. Surgical instruments and transmitters should be sterile. Regulations and laws on the use of drugs in animals should be followed, particularly those concerned with anesthetics and antibiotics used on free-ranging fish. Exceptions to surgical procedures should be made only when circumstances are extreme enough to warrant the use of less than optimal procedures.},

However, regional projections do not always match global projections and species with global distributions may exhibit varying regional susceptibility to climate change. Here we show the effect of local climatic conditions on the hatchling output of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) at four nesting sites encompassing the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. We found a heterogeneous effect of climate. Hatchling output increased with long-term precipitation in areas with dry climatic conditions (Playa Grande, Pacific Ocean and Sandy Point, Caribbean Sea), but the effect varied in areas where precipitation was high (Pacuare, Caribbean Sea) and was not detected at the temperate site (Maputaland, Indian Ocean). High air temperature reduced hatchling output only at the area experiencing seasonal droughts (Playa Grande). Climatic projections showed a drastic increase in air temperature and a mild decrease in precipitation at all sites by 2100. The most unfavorable conditions were projected for Sandy Point where hatching success has already declined over time along with precipitation levels. The heterogeneous effect of climate may lead to local extinctions of leatherback turtles in some areas but survival in others by 2100.},

abstract = {Background: Biotelemetry has become a key tool for studying marine animals in the last decade, and a wide range of electronic tags are now available for answering a range of research questions. However, comparatively, less attention has been given to attachment methods for these tags and the implications of tag retention on study design, especially when designing a comparative study looking at multiple species. Here, we reported our findings on acoustic tag retention rates for juveniles of two species of marine turtle: the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) and the hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata). We captured both species twice annually (spring and fall) from 2012 through 2017, as part of a capture-mark-recapture study at Buck Island Reef National Monument, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. We assessed tag retention rates using physical recaptures of turtles previously outfitted with an acoustic tag. Results: We deployed 72 acoustic tags on 60 juvenile greens and 37 acoustic tags on 29 hawksbills. We estimated the half-life for tags on greens to be 150 days (95{\%} CI 117-188 days), whereas the half-life for tags on hawksbills was 1077 days (95{\%} CI 870-2118 days), a marked difference. We observed that tag attachment holes, drilled into the posterior marginal scutes, migrated laterally towards the outer edge of the marginals in both species. Green turtles tended to exhibit tear-outs, as their attachment holes wore and/or tags grew near the edge of their scutes, whereas hawksbills tended to maintain the structure of these holes and did not exhibit these tear-outs. Conclusions: We conclude that hawksbills can be tagged with long-battery-life acoustic tags for long-term studies of habitat use and movement patterns, whereas greens are likely to shed their tags in the 1st year, making long-term studies difficult. This study is the first clear evidence that tagging protocols should vary between species of hard-shelled turtles. Furthermore, shed tags on the seafloor continue to be detected by acoustic receivers, creating a challenge in data filtering before analysis. We encourage future research into an efficient method for filtering these data points prior to analysis.},

Over the past decade, these tags have emerged as an important tool and have been used extensively for tracking animal migrations, most commonly small birds. Analysing geolocator data can be daunting to new and experienced scientists alike. Over the past decades, several methods with fundamental differences in the analytical approach have been developed to cope with the various caveats and the often complicated data. Here, we explain the concepts behind the analyses of geolocator data and provide a practical guide for the common steps encompassing most analyses – annotation of twilights, calibration, estimating and refining locations, and extraction of movement patterns – describing good practices and common pitfalls for each step. We discuss criteria for deciding whether or not geolocators can answer proposed research questions, provide guidance in choosing an appropriate analysis method and introduce key features of the newest open-source analysis tools. We provide advice for how to interpret and report results, highlighting parameters that should be reported in publications and included in data archiving. Finally, we introduce a comprehensive supplementary online manual that applies the concepts to several datasets, demonstrates the use of open-source analysis tools with step-by-step instructions and code and details our recommendations for interpreting, reporting and archiving.},

abstract = {Elucidating spatio-temporal movements of animals is an integral component of wildlife conservation and protected species management. Between 2008 and 2010 we satellite tracked 15 adult female hawksbill turtles Eretmochelys imbricata in the eastern Pacific Ocean to evaluate their movement behavior and to guide management and conservation efforts of this highly endangered population. Movements and habitat use were highly neritic, and post-nesting migration distances (maximum = 283.11 km) were short relative to migrations of other sea turtle species. In foraging areas, the majority of hawksbills established restricted, inshore home ranges within mangrove estuaries. A large proportion ({\textgreater}65{\%}) of turtle location points fell within protected areas, although many of these sites lack enforcement and monitoring. The consistent use of estuar-ine and mangrove habitat for nesting and foraging may explain why hawksbills went virtually undetected in the eastern Pacific for decades. The spatially restricted and neritic life cycles of adult hawksbills in the eastern Pacific highlight threats (e.g. overlap with coastal fisheries, increased susceptibility to habitat degradation and/or catastrophic events) and opportunities for conservation (e.g. acute conservation target areas, less variant jurisdictional boundaries/regulations) for this species. Our results underscore the importance of strengthening protected area management, mangrove estuary protection and hawksbill research and conservation in the eastern Pacific. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract = {Prior to 2007, efforts to monitor and conserve hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) in the eastern Pacific Ocean were opportunistic and records were virtually non-existent. The first abundance estimates were published in 2010, but contained limited data on the species. Ongoing research since that time has led to the identification of several rookeries, including sites containing large proportions of the overall hawksbill nesting currently known to occur in the region. Monitoring projects were established at several sites and have since provided substantial nesting data on the species. Here we summarize data collected between 1983 and March 2016 from all sites (n = 9) confirmed to host {\textgreater}10 nests in any given season to provide an update on hawksbill nesting in the eastern Pacific. We documented a total of 3,508 hawksbill nests, 265,024 hatchlings and 528 individual nesting females in the region. The vast majority of these records (99.4{\%}, 99.9{\%} and 99.6{\%}, respectively) were generated subsequent to 2007, coinciding with the discovery of eight of the nine rookeries included in this study and the organization of monitoring efforts at those sites, which led to the increased documentation conferred here. Our findings should not be misconstrued as increases in actual nesting or signs of recovery, which could diminish the ongoing need for conservation actions, but rather as optimism, that there is still an opportunity to restore the species in the eastern Pacific. The top three sites in terms of average annual number of nests were Estero Padre Ramos (Nicaragua; 213.2 ± 47.6 nests), Bahia de Jiquilisco (El Salvador; 168.5 ± 46.7 nests) and Aserradores (Nicaragua; 100.0 ± 24.0 nests), and all three sites are located in mangrove estuaries in Central America, highlighting the importance of these rookeries/habitats for the survival and recovery of hawksbills in the region. The remaining six sites received between 6.9 ± 7.3 nests (Costa Careyes, Mexico) and 59.3 ± 17.7 nests (Los Cobanos, El Salvador) annually. By integrating data collected on nesting hawksbills with local conservation realities at the most important known hawksbill rookeries in the eastern Pacific, we provide a more holistic view of the conservation status and management needs of the species in this ocean region.},

abstract = {Biologging technology has provided scientists with unprecedented tools to investigate the ecology and behaviour of marine animals, but tag deployment and attachment methods have lagged behind. Electronic tagging of elasmobranchs still essentially involves implanting anchors or drilling the fins of restrained animals. Here, we present two new non-invasive methods for deploying satellite and biologging tags on pelagic sharks and rays that do not require restraining or manipulation of the animals, nor the attachment of intramuscular anchors. The attachment of a modified fin clamp and a harness systems were tested on 12 blue sharks and four devil rays in the Azores, mid-north Atlantic. Clamps and harnesses were fitted with galvanic timed releases and deployed manually by a free diver or from the boat using a harness tagging pole. The tags remained on the animals over the entire short-term duration of the trials. Focal observations and deployment data suggest that both methods produce little or no adverse behavioural reaction on the animals, offering a valid alternative for short-term tagging of pelagic sharks and rays. Deployment length can be substantially increased by selecting longer duration galvanic timed releases.},

abstract = {Long-term bio-logging has the potential to reveal how movements, and hence life-history trade-offs, vary over a lifetime. Reproductive tactics in particular may vary as individuals' trade-off current investment versus lifetime fitness. Male African savanna elephants (Loxodona africana) provide a telling example of balancing body growth with reproductive fitness due to the combination of indeterminate growth and strongly delineated periods of sexual activity (musth), which results in reproductive tactics that alter with age. Our study aims to quantify the extent to which male elephants alter their movement patterns, and hence energetic allocation, in relation to (a) reproductive state and (b) age, and (c) to determine whether musth periods can be detected directly from GPS tracking data. We used a combination of GPS tracking data and visual observations of 25 male elephants ranging in age from 20 to 52 years to examine the influence of reproductive state and age on movement. We then used a three-state hidden Markov model (HMM) to detect musth behaviour in a subset of sequential tracking data. Our results demonstrate that male elephants increased their daily mean speed and range size with age and in musth. Furthermore, non-musth speed decreased with age, presumably reflecting a shift towards energy acquisition during non-musth. Thus, despite similar speeds and marginally larger ranges between reproductive states at age 20, by age 50, males were travelling 2.0 times faster in a 3.5 times larger area in musth relative to non-musth. The distinctiveness of musth periods over age 35 meant the three-state HMM could automatically detect musth movement with high sensitivity and specificity, but could not for the younger age class. We show that male elephants increased their energetic allocation into reproduction with age as the probability of reproductive success increases. Given that older male elephants tend to be both the target of legal trophy hunting and illegal poaching, man-made interference could drive fundamental changes in elephant reproductive tactics. Bio-logging, as our study reveals, has the potential both to quantify mature elephant reproductive tactics remotely and to be used to institute proactive management strategies around the reproductive behaviour of this charismatic keystone species.},

abstract = {The Costa Rica Dome is similar to other tropical thermocline domes in several respects: it is part of an east-west thermocline ridge associated with the equatorial circulation, surface currents flow cyclonically around it, and its seasonal evolution is affected by large-scale wind patterns. The Costa Rica Dome is unique because it is also forced by a coastal wind jet. Monthly climatological fields of thermocline depth and physical forcing variables (wind stress curl and surface current divergence) were analyzed to examine the structure and seasonal evolution of the dome. The annual cycle of the dome can be explained by wind forcing in four stages: (1) coastal shoaling of the thermocline off the Gulf of Papagayo during February-April, forced by Ekman pumping on the equatorward side of the Papagayo wind jet; (2) separation from the coast during May-June when the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) moves north to the countercurrent thermocline ridge, the wind jet stops, and the North Equatorial Countercurrent extends toward the coast on the equatorward flank of the ridge; (3) countercurrent thermocline ridging during July-November, when the dome expands to the west as the countercurrent thermocline ridge shoals beneath a band of cyclonic wind stress curl on the poleward side of the ITCZ; and (4) deepening during December-January when the ITCZ moves south and strong trade winds blow over the dome. Coastal eddies may be involved in the coastal shoaling observed during February-March. A seasonally predictable, strong, and shallow thermocline makes the Costa Rica Dome a distinct biological habitat where phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass are higher than in surrounding tropical waters. The physical structure and biological productivity of the dome affect the distribution and feeding of whales and dolphins, probably through forage availability.},

abstract = {Summary 1. Pacific leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea populations have been declining precipitously. It has been suggested that fishery-associated mortality is the leading factor causing the decline; however, the sensitivity of leatherbacks to climate variability relative to their population ecology is unknown. 2. We investigated the effects of interannual climate variability, as governed by the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), on leatherback nesting ecology. We used equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly data over various time scales derived from both moored buoys and remote satellites as signals of ENSO. We then incorporated these data into a remigration probability model for the largest nesting population of eastern Pacific leatherbacks at Parque Nacional Marino Las Baulas (PNMB), Costa Rica. 3. Our results showed that nesting females of PNMB exhibited a strong sensitivity to ENSO, as reflected in their nesting remigration probabilities. Cool La Nina events corresponded with a higher remigration probability and warm El Nino events corresponded with a lower remigration probability. 4. We suggest that productivity transitions at leatherback foraging areas in the eastern equatorial and south-eastern Pacific in response to El Nino/La Nina events result in variable remigration intervals and thus variable annual egg production. This phenomenon may render the eastern Pacific leatherback population more vulnerable to anthropogenic mortality than other populations. 5. Synthesis and applications. Physical indices of environmental variation can be used to estimate the probability of leatherbacks remigrating to nest at PNMB. This type of modelling approach can be extremely useful for understanding the effects of climatic variation on the population dynamics of sea turtles. Our remigration probability model can be applied to any monitored sea turtle nesting population where nesting site fidelity and beach monitoring coverage remains high. This modelling approach can help nesting beach monitoring programmes forecast remigrant numbers based on prior climate data, and can further quantify anthropogenic mortality by validating survival estimates.

abstract = {Mangrove forests, one of the world's most endangered ecosystems, are also some of the most difficult to access. This is especially true along the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, where 99{\%} of the country's mangroves occur. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), or drones, have become a convenient tool for natural area assessment, and offer a solution to the problems of remote mangrove monitoring. This study is the first to use UAS to analyze the structure of a mangrove forests within Central America. Our goals were to (1) determine the forest structure of two estuaries in northwestern Costa Rica through traditional ground measurements, (2) assess the accuracy of UAS measurements of canopy height and percent coverage and (3) determine whether the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) could discriminate between the most abundant mangrove species. We flew a UAS equipped with a single NDVI sensor during the peak wet (Sept–Nov) and dry (Jan–Feb) seasons. The structure and species composition of the estuaries showed a possible transition between the wet mangroves of southern Costa Rica and the drier northern mangroves. UAS-derived measurements at 100 cm/pixel resolution of percent canopy coverage and maximum and mean canopy height were not statistically different from ground measurements (p {\textgreater}0.05). However, there were differences in mean canopy height at 10 cm/pixel resolution (p = 0.043), indicating diminished returns in accuracy as resolution becomes extremely fine. Mean NDVI values of Avicennia germinans (most abundant species) changed significantly between seasons (p {\textless}0.001). Mean NDVI of Rhizophora racemosa (second most abundant species) was significantly different from A. germinans and dry forest dominant plots during the dry season (p {\textless}0.001), demonstrating NDVI's capability of discriminating mangrove species. This study provides the first structural assessment of the studied estuaries and a framework for future studies of mangroves using UAS.},

A few years later Meier and Staffelbach demonstrated a special technique, usually referred to as fast correlation attacks, that is very effective if the feedback polynomial has a special form, namely, if its weight is very low. Due to this seminal result, it is a well known fact that one avoids low weight feedback polynomials in the design of LFSR based stream ciphers. This paper identifies a new class of such weak feedback polynomials, polynomials of the form f(x) = g 1 (x)+g 2 (x)x M1 + ... + g t (x)x Mt-1 , where g 1 ,g 2 ,...,g t are all polynomials of low degree. For such feedback polynomials, we identify an efficient correlation attack in the form of a distinguishing attack. {\textcopyright} International Association for Cryptologic Research 2004.},

abstract = {Top pelagic predators such as tunas, sharks, marine turtles and mammals have historically been difficult to study due to their large body size and vast range over the oceanic habitat. In recent years the development of small microprocessor-based data storage tags that are surgically implanted or satellite-linked provide marine researchers a novel avenue for examining the movements, physiology and behaviors of pelagic animals in the wild. When biological and physical data obtained from the tags are combined with satellite derived sea surface temperature and ocean color data, the relationships between the movements, behaviors and physical ocean environment can be examined. Tag-bearing marine animals can function as autonomous ocean profilers providing oceanographic data wherever their long migrations take them. The biologging science is providing ecological physiologists with new insights into the seasonal movements, habitat utilization, breeding behaviors and population structures in of marine vertebrates. In addition, the data are revealing migration corridors, hot spots and physical oceanographic patterns that are key to understanding how organisms such as bluefin tunas use the open ocean environment. In the 21st century as ecosystem degradation and global warming continue to threaten the existence of species on Earth, the field of physiological ecology will play a more pivotal role in conservation biology.},

abstract = {Blue whales Balaenoptera musculus meet the highest prey demands of any predator that has ever existed by feeding exclusively upon dense but patchy schools of pelagic euphausiids. We examined the role that seasonally high primary production supported by coastal upwelling combined with topographic breaks off California play in creating, collecting, and maintaining euphausiids at densities sufficient to allow exploitation by whales. We used concurrent ship- and mooring-based oceanographic, hydroacoustic, and net sampling, whale-sighting records, visual surveys, and time-depth recorder deployment to examine temporal and spatial linkages between (1) intensity of upwelling, (2) primary production, (3) development, density and distribution of euphausiids, and (4) the distribution, abundance, and foraging behavior of blue whales in Monterey Bay, California between 1992 and 1996. Blue whales fed exclusively upon adult euphausiids Thysanoessa spinifera and Euphausia pacifica that were larger than those generally available in the Bay. Foraging whales dove repeatedly to dense euphausiid aggregations between 150 and 200 m on the edge of the Monterey Bay Submarine Canyon. Euphausiid aggregations where whales were foraging averaged 153 g m-3, approximately 2 orders of magnitude greater than mean euphausiid densities in the Bay (1.3 g m-3). High euphausiid densities are supported by high primary production between April and August (249 mgC m-3 d-1) and a submarine canyon that provides deep water down-current from an upwelling region. Peak euphausiid densities occur in late summer/early fall, lagging the seasonal increase in primary production by 3 to 4 mo. This lag results from the temporal development of euphausiids spawned around the spring increase in primary production and the shoreward collapse of productivity due to decreased upwelling in late summer. The migratory movements of the California blue whale probably reflect seasonal patterns in productivity in other foraging areas similar to those we describe for Monterey Bay. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2005.},

abstract = {As ectotherms, sea turtles are particularly sensitive to ambient temperature. Because of their charismatic megafauna and imperiled status, there is considerable interest as to how species in this taxon have responded to recent ocean warming and may respond to predicted warming trends. The fact that they are wide-ranging and evolutionarily ancient organisms suggests that marine turtles withstood changing climatic conditions in the past. To test if there are thermal cues that relate to dynamic nesting behaviours of loggerheads Caretta caretta and green turtles Chelonia mydas, we examined 20 yr (1989–2008) data sets of beach monitoring surveys and satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) from an important nesting site in east central Florida, USA, and adjacent Atlantic waters, respectively. For both species, median nesting dates became significantly earlier with higher May SSTs. However, the standard deviation of nest distributions, used as an analog for nesting season length, decreased for loggerheads and, in contrast, increased for green turtles with a higher average daily SST. This differential response between the species may reflect changes in reproductive physiology (e.g. internesting interval times and clutch numbers) and could have bearing on the future population dynamics of the 2 species.},

The presence of subadult hawksbills around Masirah suggests that there is a resident population there. Those on Masirah island are smaller and lay fewer eggs than hawksbills from Costa Rica, Guyana, or the Seychelles. The annual cold upwelling along the South Arabian Coast may be the causal factor.

Although tri-axial accelerometers are increasingly employed for this purpose, their application in smallbodied animals has been limited by weight restrictions. Additionally, accelerometers engender novel complications, as a system is needed to reliably map acceleration to behaviors. In this study, we describe newly developed, tiny acceleration-logging devices (1.5-2.5 g) and use them to characterize behavior in two chipmunk species. We collected paired accelerometer readings and behavioral observations from captive individuals. We then employed techniques from machine learning to develop an automatic system for coding accelerometer readings into behavioral categories.Finally,we deployed and recovered accelerometers from free-living, wild chipmunks. This is the first time to our knowledge that accelerometers have been used to generate behavioral data for small-bodied ({\textless}100 g), free-living mammals.},

abstract = {The advent of miniaturized biologging devices has provided ecologists with unprecedented opportunities to record animal movement across scales, and led to the collection of ever-increasing quantities of tracking data. In parallel, sophisticated tools have been developed to process, visualize and analyse tracking data; however, many of these tools have proliferated in isolation, making it challenging for users to select the most appropriate method for the question in hand. Indeed, within the r software alone, we listed 58 packages created to deal with tracking data or ‘tracking packages'. Here, we reviewed and described each tracking package based on a workflow centred around tracking data (i.e. spatio-temporal locations (x, y, t)), broken down into three stages: pre-processing, post-processing and analysis, the latter consisting of data visualization, track description, path reconstruction, behavioural pattern identification, space use characterization, trajectory simulation and others. Supporting documentation is key to render a package accessible for users. Based on a user survey, we reviewed the quality of packages' documentation and identified 11 packages with good or excellent documentation. Links between packages were assessed through a network graph analysis. Although a large group of packages showed some degree of connectivity (either depending on functions or suggesting the use of another tracking package), one third of the packages worked in isolation, reflecting a fragmentation in the r movement-ecology programming community. Finally, we provide recommendations for users when choosing packages, and for developers to maximize the usefulness of their contribution and strengthen the links within the programming community.},

abstract = {Hawksbill sea turtles are the most tropical sea turtle species with one of the last remaining aggregations in West Africa found on Pr{\'{i}}ncipe Island (1° 37′ N; 7° 23′ E). Here we present for the first time, data on the trophic and foraging ecology of both juvenile and adult hawksbill turtles found in the shallow waters of Pr{\'{i}}ncipe, using stable isotope analyses of carbon ($\delta$13C) and nitrogen ($\delta$15N), and assess any isotopic niche segregation between these two life-stages. Hawksbill turtles were sampled from December 2012 to June 2014, complementary to a snorkeling survey conducted around the entire coastline (ca. 100 km). $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N values were measured in epidermal samples of 40 individuals and analyzed in the context of isotopic niche width and overlap (i.e. trophic and foraging niches). Juveniles hawksbills (n = 29; {\textless} 60 cm curved carapace length (CCL)) occupy a significant smaller isotopic niche than adults (n = 11; {\textgreater} 75 cm), especially in relation to $\delta$13C values (i.e. habitat use) but also in $\delta$15N values (i.e. trophic level). Variances between adults and juveniles were not homogenous for both isotopes and larger for adults, particularly for $\delta$13C values. We found significant differences in $\delta$13C values between the two groups, but not for $\delta$15N, and a significant correlation between $\delta$13C values and CCL for the pooled data. SIBER (stable isotopes Bayesian ellipses in R) outcomes support these results and, although niches are not completely segregated, it indicates spatial foraging segregation between juveniles and adults. The fact that Pr{\'{i}}ncipe Island's shallow waters are constantly being patrolled by spearfishermen, together with the existence of a large insular platform and a superior dive capacity in larger hawksbills, might influence this segregation. Our results suggest that part of the adults may be originating from isotopically distinct areas. To have a better understanding on the distribution and abundance of the sea turtle populations in Pr{\'{i}}ncipe, including their connectivity with other foraging and breeding areas, future in-water studies focused mainly on the entire insular platform of Pr{\'{i}}ncipe, but also on the adjacent probable foraging areas of the Gulf of Guinea, are required.},

abstract = {Satellite telemetry was used to track inter-nesting, post-nesting, and foraging movements of six green turtles that nested on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea at the end of the 2019 nesting season, as well as foraging movements of five green turtles after the 2018 nesting season (n = 11 across two seasons), from the same nesting population. These tracks were fit with a switching state-space model to characterize movements and then analyzed in relation to environmental and anthropogenic factors. Inter-nesting movements of two turtles included separate oceanic loops, in which turtles traveled {\textgreater}40 km away from nesting beaches. Four complete migrations were observed to two distinct foraging grounds, with two turtles migrating west for an average of 1064 km to the coastal waters of Ghana, and two migrating south for an average of 1563 km to a newly discovered foraging ground in the coastal waters of Angola. All migrations included intermittent foraging at stopover sites, including one period of possible oceanic foraging. Turtles at both foraging grounds maintained distinct core use areas in shallow, near-shore ({\textless}20 km from coast) waters. Spatial and depth data reveal critical habitats for this population throughout inter-nesting, post-nesting, and foraging behaviors. Tracks spanned nine countries, highlighting the need for multi-national cooperation in the development of marine conservation management plans in the area. The long distances covered by these turtles suggests that fisheries bycatch and direct harvest throughout the East Atlantic may impact this population. Additionally, spatial and dive depth data can inform zonal fishing regulations and provide the information needed to modify fishing practices and gear in ways likely to reduce sea turtle bycatch.},

abstract = {The evolution and improvement of novel applications on acoustic telemetry technology are driven mainly by the need to address more complex behavioral, ecological and physiological questions. A new Vemco VR2W Positioning System (VPS) is described and tested here using an array of 16 VR2W acoustic monitoring receivers and 8 fixed synchronizing transmitters. VPS positioning algorithm is based on the 3-receiver time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) algorithm used by the existing Vemco VRAP system, extended to work with an array of three or more receivers that do not have synchronized clocks. The positional accuracy and performance of the VPS was estimated on a stationary and a slow-moving coded transmitter, and on two free-swimming elasmobranch species. Mean positional accuracy (±SD) of VPS estimates from a stationary transmitter deployed at several locations within the receiver array was 2.64 ± 2.32. m. Positional error was significantly lower inside (2.13 ± 1.31. m) than outside the array (5.12 ± 4.11. m; p{\textless}0001). There were no significant differences in positional accuracy between stationary and moving tests (4.09 ± 2.53. m; p= 0.067). Furthermore, home range estimates and movement parameters of two elasmobranch species tracked simultaneously with VPS and active tracking were statistically similar (p{\textgreater}0.05). Our results suggest that the positional accuracy of the VPS is comparable to active tracking; however, researchers must consider specific environmental and biological variables when using the VPS. Additionally, the number, layout and proximity of acoustic receivers and synchronizing transmitters can improve considerably the performance of the VPS. The VPS provides a more efficient, less expensive approach to study and quantify fine-scale, long-term movements and habitat use of multiple individuals simultaneously, with the potential for improving our understanding on ecological and behavioral population level processes in aquatic environments. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Single turnover experiments at alkaline pH have revealed the presence of a millisecond high-spin heme intermediate. It is widely presumed that this species is an iron(III)-peroxynitrite species, but detailed characterization of the intermediate is lacking. Using resonance Raman spectroscopy and rapid-freeze quench techniques, we identify the millisecond intermediate as an iron(III)-nitrato complex with a symmetric NO(2) stretch at 1282 cm(-1). Greater time resolution techniques will be required to detect the putative iron(III) peroxynitrite complex.},

abstract = {The early life of animals is a period of high mortality, when foraging capacities are assumed to be improved progressively. In birds, this critical period involves the improvement of the flight. How do young birds gain these capacities has rarely been studied in natural conditions especially in seabirds that spend most of their life at sea. We used detailed GPS and body acceleration data on 37 great frigatebirds (Fregata minor), to test the hypothesis that juveniles starting their first flights have lower flying capacities than adults, but that these capacities will improve during a long learning period, before independence from parents, specific to this seabird that can spend months on the wing at sea. We found that most flight components improved over time to tend towards those of adults, especially the travel speed, range, duration and maximum altitude of trips. However, unexpectedly, juveniles had higher ascent rates, soaring and gliding capacities above the sea than adults. Moreover, energy expenditure of juveniles was similar to adults during low cost travelling movements and during active foraging, but juveniles spent more time foraging actively than adults. Our results suggest that flight tactics based on long-distance effortless movements specific to this family are acquired during a long period, but soaring and gliding capacities are already inherited by juveniles and possibly favoured by morphological adaptations specific to juveniles. These adaptations might explain the extreme dispersive capacities of juveniles.},

abstract = {Atlantic leatherback sea turtles migrate annually from foraging grounds off eastern Canada and the northeastern United States to southern foraging and breeding areas. Using Cox's proportional hazards model, we investigated the individual timing of the southward migrations of 27 turtles equipped with satellite-linked transmitters off Nova Scotia compared with turtle characteristics and satellite-measured ocean variables. Latitude, longitude, 1-week lagged average sea surface temperature, and 1-week lagged average chlorophyll-a concentration appear to influence the probability of departure. Higher temperature and, in the northern range of the study, higher chlorophyll concentration increased departure rates, perhaps due to the acceleration of the life cycle of the leatherback's gelatinous prey and/or increased feeding efficiency in these areas. This study highlights the opportunity to use satellite telemetry and environmental data to examine the cues for and timing of animal migrations and expands the study of migration timing to include a new species and environment. {\textcopyright}The Author 2007.

abstract = {Shifting suitable range limits under global warming will threaten many species. Modeling and mapping these potential range shifts is important for conservation. As global warming will introduce new sets of abiotic conditions, predictive empirical niche models may not perform well and the best method to model a specie's projected range shifts may be to model their fundamental niche with a biophysical mechanistic niche model. However, this class of model requires many physiological parameters that are difficult to measure for species not easily kept in captivity. It is also difficult to estimate these parameters for marine species given the interactions among their in-water motion, metabolism, and heat transfer. To surmount these difficulties, we use our previously verified novel technique combining 3D digital design, computational fluid dynamics, and finite volume heat transfer modeling to find animal core temperatures. We then use this method to build a fundamental niche map for internesting and nesting leatherback sea turtles (. Dermochelys coriacea). With these niche maps we analyze three main nesting areas. We show that global warming poses a large overheating risk to leatherbacks in Southeast Asia, a slight risk to leatherbacks in the West Atlantic and a low risk to leatherbacks in the East Atlantic. We also show that the impact may be less on leatherbacks that shift their nesting location or who are smaller. Methods such these are important to produce efficiently and economically accurate maps of regions that will become inhospitable to species under global warming conditions.},

@article{Browning2018,
abstract = {To prevent further global declines in biodiversity, identifying and understanding key habitats is crucial for successful conservation strategies. For example, globally, seabird populations are under threat and animal movement data can identify key at-sea areas and provide valuable information on the state of marine ecosystems. To date, in order to locate these areas, studies have used global positioning system (GPS) to record position and are sometimes combined with time–depth recorder (TDR) devices to identify diving activity associated with foraging, a crucial aspect of at-sea behaviour. However, the use of additional devices such as TDRs can be expensive, logistically difficult and may adversely affect the animal. Alternatively, behaviours may be resolved from measurements derived from the movement data alone. However, this behavioural analysis frequently lacks validation data for locations predicted as foraging (or other behaviours). Here, we address these issues using a combined GPS and TDR dataset from 108 individuals by training deep learning models to predict diving in European shags, common guillemots and razorbills. We validate our predictions using withheld data, producing quantitative assessment of predictive accuracy. The variables used to train these models are those recorded solely by the GPS device: variation in longitude and latitude, altitude and coverage ratio (proportion of possible fixes acquired within a set window of time). Different combinations of these variables were used to explore the qualities of different models, with the optimum models for all species predicting non-diving and diving behaviour correctly over 94{\%} and 80{\%} of the time, respectively. We also demonstrate the superior predictive ability of these supervised deep learning models over other commonly used behavioural prediction methods such as hidden Markov models. Mapping these predictions provides useful insights into the foraging activity of a range of seabird species, highlighting important at sea locations. These models have the potential to be used to analyse historic GPS datasets and further our understanding of how environmental changes have affected these seabirds over time.},

abstract = {Accelerometry is growing in popularity for remotely measuring fish swimming metrics, but appropriate sampling frequencies for accurately measuring these metrics are not well studied. This research examined the influence of sampling frequency (1–25 Hz) with tri-axial accelerometer biologgers on estimates of overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), tail-beat frequency, swimming speed and metabolic rate of bonefish Albula vulpes in a swim-tunnel respirometer and free-swimming in a wetland mesocosm. In the swim tunnel, sampling frequencies of ≥ 5 Hz were sufficient to establish strong relationships between ODBA, swimming speed and metabolic rate. However, in free-swimming bonefish, estimates of metabolic rate were more variable below 10 Hz. Sampling frequencies should be at least twice the maximum tail-beat frequency to estimate this metric effectively, which is generally higher than those required to estimate ODBA, swimming speed and metabolic rate. While optimal sampling frequency probably varies among species due to tail-beat frequency and swimming style, this study provides a reference point with a medium body-sized sub-carangiform teleost fish, enabling researchers to measure these metrics effectively and maximize study duration.},

abstract = {Prior to 2008 and the discovery of several important hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) nesting colonies in the EP (Eastern Pacific), the species was considered virtually absent from the region. Research since that time has yielded new insights into EP hawksbills, salient among them being the use of mangrove estuaries for nesting. These recent revelations have raised interest in the genetic characterization of hawksbills in the EP, studies of which have remained lacking to date. Between 2008 and 2014, we collected tissue samples from 269 nesting hawksbills at nine rookeries across the EP and used mitochondrial DNA sequences (766 bp) to generate the first genetic characterization of rookeries in the region. Our results inform genetic diversity, population differentiation, and phylogeography of the species. Hawksbills in the EP demonstrate low genetic diversity: We identified a total of only seven haplotypes across the region, including five new and two previously identified nesting haplotypes (pooled frequencies of 58.4{\%} and 41.6{\%}, respectively), the former only evident in Central American rookeries. Despite low genetic diversity, we found strong stock structure between the four principal rookeries, suggesting the existence of multiple populations and warranting their recognition as distinct management units. Furthermore, haplotypes EiIP106 and EiIP108 are unique to hawksbills that nest in mangrove estuaries, a behavior found only in hawksbills along Pacific Central America. The detected genetic differentiation supports the existence of a novel mangrove estuary "reproductive ecotype" that may warrant additional conservation attention. From a phylogeographic perspective, our research indicates hawksbills colonized the EP via the Indo-Pacific, and do not represent relict populations isolated from the Atlantic by the rising of the Panama Isthmus. Low overall genetic diversity in the EP is likely the combined result of few rookeries, extremely small reproductive populations and evolutionarily recent colonization events. Additional research with larger sample sizes and variable markers will help further genetic understanding of hawksbill turtles in the EP.},

Path segmentation methods provide basics for detecting movement changes and the behavioral mechanisms driving them. However, available path segmentation methods differ vastly with respect to underlying statistical assumptions and output produced. Consequently, it is currently difficult for researchers new to path segmentation to gain an overview of the different methods, and choose one that is appropriate for their data and research questions. Here, we provide an overview of different methods for segmenting movement paths according to potential changes in underlying behavior. To structure our overview, we outline three broad types of research questions that are commonly addressed through path segmentation: 1) the quantitative description of movement patterns, 2) the detection of significant change-points, and 3) the identification of underlying processes or 'hidden states'. We discuss advantages and limitations of different approaches for addressing these research questions using path-level movement data, and present general guidelines for choosing methods based on data characteristics and questions. Our overview illustrates the large diversity of available path segmentation approaches, highlights the need for studies that compare the utility of different methods, and identifies opportunities for future developments in path-level data analysis.},

abstract = {Currently, the deployment of tracking devices is one of the most frequently used approaches to study movement ecology of birds. Recent miniaturization of light-level geolocators enabled studying small bird species whose migratory patterns were widely unknown. However, geolocators may reduce vital rates in tagged birds and may bias obtained movement data. There is a need for a thorough assessment of the potential tag effects on small birds, as previous meta-analyses did not evaluate unpublished data and impact of multiple life-history traits, focused mainly on large species and the number of published studies tagging small birds has increased substantially. We quantitatively reviewed 549 records extracted from 74 published and 48 unpublished studies on over 7,800 tagged and 17,800 control individuals to examine the effects of geolocator tagging on small bird species (body mass {\textless}100 g). We calculated the effect of tagging on apparent survival, condition, phenology and breeding performance and identified the most important predictors of the magnitude of effect sizes. Even though the effects were not statistically significant in phylogenetically controlled models, we found a weak negative impact of geolocators on apparent survival. The negative effect on apparent survival was stronger with increasing relative load of the device and with geolocators attached using elastic harnesses. Moreover, tagging effects were stronger in smaller species. In conclusion, we found a weak effect on apparent survival of tagged birds and managed to pinpoint key aspects and drivers of tagging effects. We provide recommendations for establishing matched control group for proper effect size assessment in future studies and outline various aspects of tagging that need further investigation. Finally, our results encourage further use of geolocators on small bird species but the ethical aspects and scientific benefits should always be considered.},

Nutrients fuel the growth of phytoplankton, the base of a very productive coastal marine ecosystem [Pauly D, Christensen V (1995) Nature 374:255-257]. Because nutrient supply and phytoplankton biomass in shelf waters are highly sensitive to variation in upwelling-driven circulation, shifts in the timing and strength of upwelling may alter basic nutrient and carbon fluxes through marine food webs. We show how a 1-month delay in the 2005 spring transition to upwelling-favorable wind stress in the northern California Current Large Marine Ecosystem resulted in numerous anomalies: warm water, low nutrient levels, low primary productivity, and an unprecedented low recruitment of rocky intertidal organisms. The delay was associated with 20- to 40-day wind oscillations accompanying a southward shift of the jet stream. Early in the upwelling season (May-July) off Oregon, the cumulative upwelling-favorable wind stress was the lowest in 20 years, nearshore surface waters averaged 2°C warmer than normal, surf-zone chlorophyll-a and nutrients were 50{\%} and 30{\%} less than normal, respectively, and densities of recruits of mussels and barnacles were reduced by 83{\%} and 66{\%}, respectively. Delayed early-season upwelling and stronger late-season upwelling are consistent with predictions of the influence of global warming on coastal upwelling regions. {\textcopyright}2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Passive acoustic telemetry provides an important tool to study the spatial ecology and behaviour of organisms in marine and freshwater systems, but understanding the detection range of acoustic receivers is critical for interpreting acoustic data and establishing receiver spacing to maximize study efficiency. This study presents a comprehensive review of how acoustic detection range has been considered and assessed to date, summarizes important variables to monitor when determining the detection range of a receiver array, and provides recommendations to account for detection range during experimental design, analysis and data interpretation. A total of 378 passive acoustic telemetry studies (1986-2012) were scored against a set of pre-defined criteria to provide a standardized assessment of how well detection range was accounted for, from a maximum possible score of 45. Scores ranged from 0 to 39 (11.1 ± 0.4; mean ± 1 SE). Over the past decade mean scores have been consistently between 6.7 and 12.9 which indicates that detection range has not been adequately considered in most contemporary acoustic telemetry studies. Given the highly variable nature of detection range over space and time, it is necessary to create a culture of detection range testing among the scientific community. For robust telemetry studies it is recommended that consideration of detection range should be given a greater focus within study design, execution and data analysis. To aid array design in new systems, short-term detection range tests should be conducted in the most representative area of the study system prior to deployment. As well, fixed distance sentinel tags should ideally be deployed at a representative receiver site within the array to provide a continuous assessment of detection range and influential environmental parameters should be monitored to facilitate modeling of detection range variability over time. When warranted, data analysis should incorporate modeled variation in detection ranges. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {In the past decade, ecologists have witnessed vast improvements in our ability to collect animal movement data through animal-borne technology, such as through GPS or ARGOS systems. However, more data does not necessarily yield greater knowledge in understanding animal ecology and conservation. In this paper, we provide a review of the major benefits, problems and potential misuses of GPS/Argos technology to animal ecology and conservation. Benefits are obvious, and include the ability to collect fine-scale spatio-temporal location data on many previously impossible to study animals, such as ocean-going fish, migratory songbirds and long-distance migratory mammals. These benefits come with significant problems, however, imposed by frequent collar failures and high cost, which often results in weaker study design, reduced sample sizes and poorer statistical inference. In addition, we see the divorcing of biologists from a field-based understanding of animal ecology to be a growing problem. Despite these difficulties, GPS devices have provided significant benefits, particularly in the conservation and ecology of wide-ranging species. We conclude by offering suggestions for ecologists on which kinds of ecological questions would currently benefit the most from GPS/Argos technology, and where the technology has been potentially misused. Significant conceptual challenges remain, however, including the links between movement and behaviour, and movement and population dynamics. {\textcopyright}2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {A goal of animal movement analysis is to reveal behavioural mechanisms by which organisms utilize complex and variable environments. Statistical analysis of movement data is complicated by the fact that the data are multidimensional, autocorrelated and often marked by error and irregular measurement intervals or gappiness. Furthermore, movement data reflect behaviours that are themselves heterogeneous. Here, we model movement data as a subsampling of a continuous stochastic processes, and introduce the behavioural change point analysis (BCPA), a likelihood-based method that allows for the identification of significant structural changes. The BCPA is robust to gappiness and measurement error, computationally efficient, easy to implement and reveals structure that is otherwise difficult to discern. We apply the analysis to a GPS movement track of a northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), revealing an unexpectedly complex diurnal behavioural profile, and demonstrate its robustness to the greater errors associated with the ARGOS tracking system. By informing empirical interpretation of movement data, we suggest that the BCPA can eventually motivate the development of mechanistic behavioural models. {\textcopyright}2009 Blackwell Publishing LtdCNRS.},

abstract = {Biologging devices are used ubiquitously across vertebrate taxa in studies of movement and behavioural ecology to record data from organisms without the need for direct observation. Despite the dramatic increase in the sophistication of this technology, progress in reducing the impact of these devices to animals is less obvious, notwithstanding the implications for animal welfare. Existing guidelines focus on tag weight (e.g. the ‘5{\%} rule'), ignoring aero/hydrodynamic forces in aerial and aquatic organisms, which can be considerable. Designing tags to minimize such impact for animals moving in fluid environments is not trivial, as the impact depends on the position of the tag on the animal, as well as its shape and dimensions. We demonstrate the capabilities of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling to optimize the design and positioning of biologgers on marine animals, using the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) as a model species. Specifically, we investigate the effects of (a) tag form, (b) tag size, and (c) tag position and quantify the impact under frontal hydrodynamic forces, as encountered by seals swimming at sea. By comparing a conventional versus a streamlined tag, we show that the former can induce up to 22{\%} larger drag for a swimming seal; to match the drag of the streamlined tag, the conventional tag would have to be reduced in size by 50{\%}. For the conventional tag, the drag induced can differ by up to 11{\%} depending on the position along the seal's body, whereas for the streamlined tag this difference amounts to only 5{\%}. We conclude by showing how the CFD simulation approach can be used to optimize tag design to reduce drag for aerial and aquatic species, including issues such as the impact of lateral currents (unexplored until now). We also provide a step-by-step guide to facilitate the implementation of CFD in biologging tag design.},

abstract = {Humans, as super predators, can have strong effects on wildlife behaviour, including profound modifications of diel activity patterns. Subsequent to the return of large carnivores to human-modified ecosystems, many prey species have adjusted their spatial behaviour to the contrasting landscapes of fear generated by both their natural predators and anthropogenic pressures. The effects of predation risk on temporal shifts in diel activity of prey, however, remain largely unexplored in human-dominated landscapes. We investigated the influence of the density of lynx Lynx lynx, a nocturnal predator, on the diel activity patterns of their main prey, the roe deer Capreolus capreolus, across a gradient of human disturbance and hunting at the European scale. Based on 11 million activity records from 431 individually GPS-monitored roe deer in 12 populations within the EURODEER network (http://eurodeer.org), we investigated how lynx predation risk in combination with both lethal and non-lethal human activities affected the diurnality of deer. We demonstrated marked plasticity in roe deer diel activity patterns in response to spatio-temporal variations in risk, mostly due to human activities. In particular, roe deer decreased their level of diurnality by a factor of 1.37 when the background level of general human disturbance was high. Hunting exacerbated this effect, as during the hunting season deer switched most of their activity to night-time and, to a lesser extent, to dawn, although this pattern varied noticeably in relation to lynx density. Indeed, in the presence of lynx, their main natural predator, roe deer were relatively more diurnal. Overall, our results revealed a strong influence of human activities and the presence of lynx on diel shifts in roe deer activity. In the context of the recovery of large carnivores across Europe, we provide important insights about the effects of predators on the behavioural responses of their prey in human-dominated ecosystems. Modifications in the temporal partitioning of ungulate activity as a response to human activities may facilitate human–wildlife coexistence, but likely also have knock-on effects for predator–prey interactions, with cascading effects on ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {Hawksbill sea turtles are the most tropical sea turtle species with one of the last remaining aggregations in West Africa found on Pr{\'{i}}ncipe Island (1° 37′ N; 7° 23′ E). Here we present for the first time, data on the trophic and foraging ecology of both juvenile and adult hawksbill turtles found in the shallow waters of Pr{\'{i}}ncipe, using stable isotope analyses of carbon ({\$}\delta{\$}13C) and nitrogen ({\$}\delta{\$}15N), and assess any isotopic niche segregation between these two life-stages. Hawksbill turtles were sampled from December 2012 to June 2014, complementary to a snorkeling survey conducted around the entire coastline (ca. 100 km). {\$}\delta{\$}13C and {\$}\delta{\$}15N values were measured in epidermal samples of 40 individuals and analyzed in the context of isotopic niche width and overlap (i.e. trophic and foraging niches). Juveniles hawksbills (n = 29; {\textless}60 cm curved carapace length (CCL)) occupy a significant smaller isotopic niche than adults (n = 11; {\textgreater}75 cm), especially in relation to {\$}\delta{\$}13C values (i.e. habitat use) but also in {\$}\delta{\$}15N values (i.e. trophic level). Variances between adults and juveniles were not homogenous for both isotopes and larger for adults, particularly for {\$}\delta{\$}13C values. We found significant differences in {\$}\delta{\$}13C values between the two groups, but not for {\$}\delta{\$}15N, and a significant correlation between {\$}\delta{\$}13C values and CCL for the pooled data. SIBER (stable isotopes Bayesian ellipses in R) outcomes support these results and, although niches are not completely segregated, it indicates spatial foraging segregation between juveniles and adults. The fact that Pr{\'{i}}ncipe Island's shallow waters are constantly being patrolled by spearfishermen, together with the existence of a large insular platform and a superior dive capacity in larger hawksbills, might influence this segregation. Our results suggest that part of the adults may be originating from isotopically distinct areas. To have a better understanding on the distribution and abundance of the sea turtle populations in Pr{\'{i}}ncipe, including their connectivity with other foraging and breeding areas, future in-water studies focused mainly on the entire insular platform of Pr{\'{i}}ncipe, but also on the adjacent probable foraging areas of the Gulf of Guinea, are required.},

abstract = {GPS-tracking devices have been used in combination with a wide range of additional sensors to study animal behaviour, physiology and interaction with their environment. Tri-axial accelerometers allow researchers to remotely infer the behaviour of individuals, at all places and times. Collection of accelerometer data is relatively cheap in terms of energy usage, but the amount of raw data collected generally requires much storage space and is particularly demanding in terms of energy needed for data transmission. Here, we propose compressing the raw accelerometer (ACC) data into summary statistics within the tracking device (before transmission) to reduce data size, as a means to overcome limitations in storage and energy capacity. We explored this type of lossy data compression in the accelerometer data of tagged Bewick's swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii collected in spring 2017. Using software settings in which bouts of 2 s of both raw ACC data and summary statistics were collected in parallel but with different bout intervals to keep total data size comparable, we created the opportunity for a direct comparison of time budgets derived by the two data collection methods. We found that the data compression in our case yielded a six times reduction in data size per bout, and concurrent, similar decreases in storage and energy use of the device. We show that with the same accuracy of the behavioural classification, the freed memory and energy of the device can be used to increase the monitoring effort, resulting in a more detailed representation of the individuals' time budget. Rare and/or short behaviours, such as daily roost flights, were picked up significantly more when collecting summary statistics instead of raw ACC data (but note differences in sampling rate). Such level of detail can be of essential importance, for instance to make a reliable estimate of the energy budgets of individuals. In conclusion, we argue that this type of lossy data compression can be a well-considered choice in study situations where limitations in energy and storage space of the device pose a problem. Ultimately, these developments can allow for long-term and nearly continuous remote monitoring of the behaviour of free-ranging animals.},

abstract = {Ecological niche theory predicts sympatric species to show segregation in their spatio-temporal habitat utilization or diet as a strategy to avoid competition. Similarly, within species individuals may specialize on specific dietary resources or foraging habitats. Such individual specialization seems to occur particularly in environments with predictable resource distribution and limited environmental variability. Still, little is known about how seasonal environmental variability affects segregation of resources within species and between closely related sympatric species. The aim of the study was to investigate the foraging behaviour of three closely related and sympatrically breeding fulmarine petrels (Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica, cape petrels Daption capense and southern fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides) in a seasonally highly variable environment (Prydz Bay, Antarctica) with the aim of assessing inter- and intraspecific overlap in utilized habitat, timing of foraging and diet and to identify foraging habitat preferences. We used GPS loggers with wet/dry sensors to assess spatial habitat utilization over the entire breeding season. Trophic overlap was investigated using stable isotope analysis based on blood, feathers and egg membranes. Foraging locations were identified using wet/dry data recorded by the GPS loggers and expectation-maximization binary clustering. Foraging habitat preferences were modelled using generalized additive models and model cross-validation. During incubation and chick-rearing, the utilization distribution of all three species overlapped significantly and species also overlapped in the timing of foraging during the day—partly during incubation and completely during chick-rearing. Isotopic centroids showed no significant segregation between at least two species for feathers and egg membranes, and among all species during incubation (reflected by blood). Within species, there was no individual specialization in foraging sites or environmental space. Furthermore, no single environmental covariate predicted foraging activity along trip trajectories. Instead, best-explanatory environmental covariates varied within and between individuals even across short temporal scales, reflecting a highly generalist behaviour of birds. Our results may be explained by optimal foraging theory. In the highly productive but spatio-temporally variable Antarctic environment, being a generalist may be key to finding mobile prey—even though this increases the potential for competition within and among sympatric species.},

abstract = {Statisticians frequently voice concern that their interactions with applied researchers start only after data have been collected. The same can be said for our experience with home-range studies. Too often, conversations about home range begin with questions concerning estimation methods, smoothing parameters, or the nature of autocorrelation. More productive efforts start by asking good (and interesting) research questions; once these questions are defined, it becomes possible to ask how various design and analysis strategies influence one's ability to answer these questions. With this process in mind, we address key sample-design and data-analysis issues related to the topic of home range. The impact of choosing a particular home-range estimator (e.g., minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimator, or local convex hull) will be question dependent, and for some problems other movement or use-based metrics (e.g., mean step lengths or time spent in particular areas) may be worthy of consideration. Thus, we argue the need for more question-driven and focused research and for clearly distinguishing the biological concept of an animal's home range from the statistical quantities one uses to investigate this concept. For comparative studies, it is important to standardize sampling regimes and estimation methods as much as possible, and to pay close attention to missing data issues. More attention should also be given to temporally changing space-use patterns, with biologically meaningful time periods (e.g., life-history stages) used to define sampling periods. Last, we argue the need for closer connections between theoretical and empirical researchers. Advances in ecological theory, and its application to natural resources management, will require carefully designed research studies to test theoretical predictions from more mechanistic modeling approaches. {\textcopyright}2012 American Society of Mammalogists.},

abstract = {A resource selection function is a model of the likelihood that an available spatial unit will be used by an animal, given its resource value. But how do we appropriately define availability? Step selection analysis deals with this problem at the scale of the observed positional data, by matching each 'used step' (connecting two consecutive observed positions of the animal) with a set of 'available steps' randomly sampled from a distribution of observed steps or their characteristics. Here we present a simple extension to this approach, termed integrated step selection analysis (iSSA), which relaxes the implicit assumption that observed movement attributes (i.e. velocities and their temporal autocorrelations) are independent of resource selection. Instead, iSSA relies on simultaneously estimating movement and resource selection parameters, thus allowing simple likelihood-based inference of resource selection within a mechanistic movement model. We provide theoretical underpinning of iSSA, as well as practical guidelines to its implementation. Using computer simulations, we evaluate the inferential and predictive capacity of iSSA compared to currently used methods. Our work demonstrates the utility of iSSA as a general, flexible and user-friendly approach for both evaluating a variety of ecological hypotheses, and predicting future ecological patterns.},

abstract = {Coincidental with the 1997-98 El Ni{\~{n}}o, overall coral bleaching (32.4{\%} of all colonies) and mortality (5.7{\%}) were observed on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, in the seasonally cool waters of the Gulf of Papagayo and in the more thermally stable waters of Golfo Dulce. At a Pavona clavus reef (Culebra Bay, Gulf of Papagayo), mean seawater temperature at 7 m depth ranged from 0.2° to 3.9°C warmer than in previous years for nearly all months during 1997 and 1998. Water column temperature to 25-30 m depth was above 29°C for several days, which exceeded the long term average. Even though mortality was low for most coral species, it was severe ({\textgreater}90{\%} decrease in live cover) in a small population of Leptoseris papyracea known only at Culebra Bay. Pocillopora spp. accounted for more than 60{\%} and 80{\%} of all bleached and dead colonies, respectively. Other coral species regained their normal pigmentation by the beginning of 1998 with little evidence of tissue mortality. The El Ni{\~{n}}o event of 1997-98 is considered the strongest on record by some measures, but coral mortality on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica was much less than in previous events, drawing attention to El Ni{\~{n}}o disturbance variability on local scales.},

abstract = {The evolution and improvement of novel applications on acoustic telemetry technology are driven mainly by the need to address more complex behavioral, ecological and physiological questions. A new Vemco VR2W Positioning System (VPS) is described and tested here using an array of 16 VR2W acoustic monitoring receivers and 8 fixed synchronizing transmitters. VPS positioning algorithm is based on the 3-receiver time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) algorithm used by the existing Vemco VRAP system, extended to work with an array of three or more receivers that do not have synchronized clocks. The positional accuracy and performance of the VPS was estimated on a stationary and a slow-moving coded transmitter, and on two free-swimming elasmobranch species. Mean positional accuracy (±SD) of VPS estimates from a stationary transmitter deployed at several locations within the receiver array was 2.64 ± 2.32. m. Positional error was significantly lower inside (2.13 ± 1.31. m) than outside the array (5.12 ± 4.11. m; p{\textless}0001). There were no significant differences in positional accuracy between stationary and moving tests (4.09 ± 2.53. m; p= 0.067). Furthermore, home range estimates and movement parameters of two elasmobranch species tracked simultaneously with VPS and active tracking were statistically similar (p{\textgreater}0.05). Our results suggest that the positional accuracy of the VPS is comparable to active tracking; however, researchers must consider specific environmental and biological variables when using the VPS. Additionally, the number, layout and proximity of acoustic receivers and synchronizing transmitters can improve considerably the performance of the VPS. The VPS provides a more efficient, less expensive approach to study and quantify fine-scale, long-term movements and habitat use of multiple individuals simultaneously, with the potential for improving our understanding on ecological and behavioral population level processes in aquatic environments. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The largest coral reef development is found in the Gulf of Chiriqu{\'{i}}. Most coral reefs and coral communities are located on islands that are distant from the mainland runoff, and tidal exposure. Coral reef studies in the Panamanian Pacific have focused around two main topics:the reproductive ecology of coral species, and the ecological responses of coral communities to El Ni{\~{n}}o sea warming. The former study has shown that the coral reproductive activity is related to thermal regimes, and has resulted in five publications involving eight species in four genera. The latter is the most important natural disturbance influencing Pacific Panamanian reefs, and is treated with five other natural disturbances including upwelling, subaerial exposures, dinoflagellate blooms, terrestrial runoff, and Acanthaster planci, which play important roles in structuring coral reef communities in Panam{\'{a}}. In addition, there are four main anthropogenic stressors influencing Panamanian reefs: coral extraction, ship groundings, herbicides, and overfishing. The chapter also discusses the management and protection of coral reefs. {\textcopyright}2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The loggerhead sea turtle is an endangered species exposed to many anthropogenic hazards in the Pacific. It is widely held that pelagic longline fisheries pose the major risk for Pacific loggerheads but the effects of other risk factors such as human-induced global climate change have rarely been considered. So we used generalised additive regression modelling and autoregressive-prewhitened cross-correlation analysis to explore whether regional ocean temperatures affect the long-term nesting population dynamics for the 2 Pacific loggerhead genetic stocks (Japan, Australia). We found that both Pacific stocks have been exposed to slowly increasing trends in mean annual sea surface temperature in their respective core regional foraging habitats over the past 50 years. We show that irrespective of whether a population was decreasing or increasing that there was an inverse correlation between nesting abundance and mean annual sea surface temperature in the core foraging region during the year prior to the summer nesting season. Cooler foraging habitat ocean temperatures are presumably associated with increased ocean productivity and prey abundance and consequently increased loggerhead breeding capacity. So warming regional ocean temperatures could lead to long-term decreased food supply and reduced nesting and recruitment unless Pacific loggerheads adapt by shifting their foraging habitat to cooler regions. So the gradual warming of the Pacific Ocean over the past 50 years is a major risk factor that must be considered in any meaningful diagnosis of the long-term declines apparent for some Pacific loggerhead nesting populations.},

abstract = {Popular frameworks for studying habitat selection include resource-selection functions (RSFs) and step-selection functions (SSFs), estimated using logistic and conditional logistic regression, respectively. Both frameworks compare environmental covariates associated with locations animals visit with environmental covariates at a set of locations assumed available to the animals. Conceptually, slopes that vary by individual, that is, random coefficient models, could be used to accommodate inter-individual heterogeneity with either approach. While fitting such models for RSFs is possible with standard software for generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs), straightforward and efficient one-step procedures for fitting SSFs with random coefficients are currently lacking. To close this gap, we take advantage of the fact that the conditional logistic regression model (i.e. the SSF) is likelihood-equivalent to a Poisson model with stratum-specific fixed intercepts. By interpreting the intercepts as a random effect with a large (fixed) variance, inference for random-slope models becomes feasible with standard Bayesian techniques, or with frequentist methods that allow one to fix the variance of a random effect. We compare this approach to other commonly applied alternatives, including models without random slopes and mixed conditional regression models fit using a two-step algorithm. Using data from mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) and Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra), we illustrate that our models lead to valid and feasible inference. In addition, we conduct a simulation study to compare different estimation approaches for SSFs and to demonstrate the importance of including individual-specific slopes when estimating individual- and population-level habitat-selection parameters. By providing coded examples using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) and Template Model Builder (TMB) for Bayesian and frequentist analysis via the R packages R-INLA and glmmTMB, we hope to make efficient estimation of RSFs and SSFs with random effects accessible to anyone in the field. SSFs with individual-specific coefficients are particularly attractive since they can provide insights into movement and habitat-selection processes at fine-spatial and temporal scales, but these models had previously been very challenging to fit.},

abstract = {Anthropogenically altered water temperatures (AAWT) have the potential to affect the movement and distribution of marine ectothermic species. Green sea turtles (GSTs) Chelonia mydas are an ectothermic species observed inhabiting 2 sites with AAWT at the northern point of their geographical range in the eastern Pacific. An acoustic receiver array was deployed with temperature loggers at the San Gabriel River, Long Beach, CA, where 2 power plants discharge warm water into the river, and at the 7th St. Basin, Seal Beach, CA, a dredged shallow basin with warmer water compared to surrounding coastal habitats during the summer months. Juvenile GSTs (n = 22, straight carapace length = 45.2 to 96.8 cm) were tagged with acoustic transmitters. Turtles in the basin migrated into the river during winter months when temperatures dropped below 15°C. During the winter, turtles were most frequently detected at the river receiver stations adjacent to and downstream of the power plants. This suggests that GSTs use the warm effluent as a thermal refuge, avoiding colder areas upstream of the power plants and near the river mouth. In the summer, turtles were most frequently detected at receiver stations upstream of the power plants, potentially exploiting areas of the river with higher primary productivity. AAWT sustain the northernmost aggregation of GSTs in the eastern Pacific year round; however, based on GST thermal tolerance, this population is expected to change their movement patterns when the power plants discontinue discharging warm water by 2029.},

Average emergence success of nests at Playa Grande, Costa Rica was 0.38 +/- A 0.27. Incubation temperature affected development of leatherback turtle eggs and emergence of hatchlings from the nest. We found that high temperatures reduced hatching success and emergence rate and increased embryonic mortality both early and late during incubation at Playa Grande. There was a temporal effect on emergence success that resulted in more hatchlings being produced at the beginning of the season, because of higher emergence success, than toward the end. Likewise, production of hatchlings varied from year to year. The average annual reproductive output was 252 +/- A 141 hatchlings per female. The 2005-2006 nesting season had the highest emergence success and produced the greatest number of hatchlings per female compared to the 2004-2005 (+120{\%}) and 2006-2007 (+41{\%}) seasons. However, average clutch size (62 +/- A 10) and clutch frequency (9.45 +/- A 1.63), were not different among years. Turtles that had nested a high number of years exhibited greater clutch frequency and arrived earlier to nest than turtles that had nested in fewer numbers of years. Nesting when environmental conditions favor high developmental success and emergence rate may constitute an advantageous reproductive strategy.},

In the Humboldt Current System off South America, little is known about the reproductive strategies of mesopelagic fishes and their utilization of highly productive coastal upwelling areas for spawning and early development. In the present study, we first document the spawning and nursery area of the highly abundant mesopelagic fish Maurolicus parvipinnis in the coastal upwelling zone off Talcahuano, central Chile. Second, we propose a mechanism by which ontogenetic and diel changes in vertical distribution of the early life history stages and the utilization of the local hydrodynamics facilitates the development of the larvae of this species over the shelf and nearby slope in a highly productive environment. Our results show that M. parvipinnis spawn during early spring at mid-depth in zones of intense upwelling. Larvae hatch mostly in the spawning area located on the southern edge of the slope, and are then advected northwards along the slope or over the shelf where high larval food concentrations occur. Over the shelf, larger larvae tend to vertically migrate, spending part of the night hours in the shallower layer where the water temperature is higher, and where food is most abundant. During the day, they remain at depth where offshore transport may be decreased. Those larvae that are not retained over the shelf are advected offshore, probably in the surface Ekman layer or in association with cold filaments that usually develop off the central zone along the shelf off Talcahuano. Although information on the spawning strategy of other Maurolicus species worldwide is sparse, there are some similarities in relation to the subsurface spawning, the larval presence in nearshore waters, and the early spring spawning season in association with periods of increased food availability. The spawning strategy described herein, therefore, may be a more common feature than previously believed for Maurolicus species, especially along coastal upwelling areas in eastern boundary currents.},

abstract = {Biologging devices are used ubiquitously across vertebrate taxa in studies of movement and behavioural ecology to record data from organisms without the need for direct observation. Despite the dramatic increase in the sophistication of this technology, progress in reducing the impact of these devices to animals is less obvious, notwithstanding the implications for animal welfare. Existing guidelines focus on tag weight (e.g. the ‘5{\%} rule'), ignoring aero/hydrodynamic forces in aerial and aquatic organisms, which can be considerable. Designing tags to minimize such impact for animals moving in fluid environments is not trivial, as the impact depends on the position of the tag on the animal, as well as its shape and dimensions. We demonstrate the capabilities of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling to optimize the design and positioning of biologgers on marine animals, using the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) as a model species. Specifically, we investigate the effects of (a) tag form, (b) tag size, and (c) tag position and quantify the impact under frontal hydrodynamic forces, as encountered by seals swimming at sea. By comparing a conventional versus a streamlined tag, we show that the former can induce up to 22{\%} larger drag for a swimming seal; to match the drag of the streamlined tag, the conventional tag would have to be reduced in size by 50{\%}. For the conventional tag, the drag induced can differ by up to 11{\%} depending on the position along the seal's body, whereas for the streamlined tag this difference amounts to only 5{\%}. We conclude by showing how the CFD simulation approach can be used to optimize tag design to reduce drag for aerial and aquatic species, including issues such as the impact of lateral currents (unexplored until now). We also provide a step-by-step guide to facilitate the implementation of CFD in biologging tag design.},

abstract = {The Beverton and Holt invariants are three special relations among life history parameters: Mxm = C1, M/K=C2, and L(xm)/Linf = C3, where M is the instantaneous natural mortality rate per individual, xm is age at maturity, K is the von Bertalanffy growth coefficient, L(xm) is length at maturity, Linf is asymptotic length, and C1, C2, and C3 are constants. In this study the Beverton and Holt invariants were obtained from maximization of the fecundity function that optimizes the trade-off between survival and fecundity; this approach applies conventional fishery models and provides estimates of the constants C1, C2, and C3. These estimates can be compared with the estimates obtained by regression of 1/M on xm, M on K, and L(xm) on Linf across species and across populations within species. The values of the constants obtained from regression across species agree closely with the theoretical values of the constants. In fishery assessments, natural mortality is often approximated using growth parameters, and the analyses reported here indicate that the relations are not just statistical relations, but rather result from fundamental ecological relations among the parameters. {\textcopyright} 1996 NRC Canada.},

In parallel, sophisticated tools have been developed to process, visualize and analyse tracking data; however, many of these tools have proliferated in isolation, making it challenging for users to select the most appropriate method for the question in hand. Indeed, within the r software alone, we listed 58 packages created to deal with tracking data or ‘tracking packages'. Here, we reviewed and described each tracking package based on a workflow centred around tracking data (i.e. spatio-temporal locations (x, y, t)), broken down into three stages: pre-processing, post-processing and analysis, the latter consisting of data visualization, track description, path reconstruction, behavioural pattern identification, space use characterization, trajectory simulation and others. Supporting documentation is key to render a package accessible for users. Based on a user survey, we reviewed the quality of packages' documentation and identified 11 packages with good or excellent documentation. Links between packages were assessed through a network graph analysis. Although a large group of packages showed some degree of connectivity (either depending on functions or suggesting the use of another tracking package), one third of the packages worked in isolation, reflecting a fragmentation in the r movement-ecology programming community. Finally, we provide recommendations for users when choosing packages, and for developers to maximize the usefulness of their contribution and strengthen the links within the programming community.},

abstract = {Reproductive output of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) is affected by the stochastic nature of emergence success. Average emergence success of nests at Playa Grande, Costa Rica was 0.38 +/- A 0.27. Incubation temperature affected development of leatherback turtle eggs and emergence of hatchlings from the nest. We found that high temperatures reduced hatching success and emergence rate and increased embryonic mortality both early and late during incubation at Playa Grande. There was a temporal effect on emergence success that resulted in more hatchlings being produced at the beginning of the season, because of higher emergence success, than toward the end. Likewise, production of hatchlings varied from year to year. The average annual reproductive output was 252 +/- A 141 hatchlings per female. The 2005-2006 nesting season had the highest emergence success and produced the greatest number of hatchlings per female compared to the 2004-2005 (+120{\%}) and 2006-2007 (+41{\%}) seasons. However, average clutch size (62 +/- A 10) and clutch frequency (9.45 +/- A 1.63), were not different among years. Turtles that had nested a high number of years exhibited greater clutch frequency and arrived earlier to nest than turtles that had nested in fewer numbers of years. Nesting when environmental conditions favor high developmental success and emergence rate may constitute an advantageous reproductive strategy.},

The mean code detection efficiency across all individual receivers and all download periods was 0.414 detections per synchronization code. On average, the code rejection coefficient was approximately 4{\%}, indicating that it was only a minor factor in reducing code detection efficiency. There were significant performance differences between stations and download periods, but no interaction between these two factors for all three metrics. Code detection efficiency, the rejection coefficient, and the noise quotient all showed significant variations with distance from the river mouth and time since deployment. Comparison of position estimates with and without efficiency produced small differences for bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) and cownose rays (Rhinoptera bonasus) monitored via this system. Root mean square errors were higher for cownose rays (48 m) than for bull sharks (23 m). Mean differences for individuals were always slightly downstream because of the increasing code detection efficiency of upriver receivers. The results of this comparison indicated that the inclusion of code detection efficiency did not significantly improve the results of the positioning algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2008 NRC.},

Understanding habitat preferences of hawksbills at different life stages is necessary to create effective local and regional conservation strategies. We studied habitat use and the diet of juvenile hawksbill sea turtles at Punta Coyote, a rocky reef located along the Nicoya Peninsula on the north Pacific coast of Costa Rica, along the northern boundary of the Caletas-Ar{\'{i}}o National Wildlife Refuge. We tracked 12 juvenile hawksbills (36-69-cm curved carapace length) with acoustic transmitters to study their habitat use. Turtles were on the rocky reef more frequently than the sandy bottoms ( 21=29.90, p=0.00). The 95{\%} fixed kernel density home range analysis revealed high-intensity use of the rocky reef, where hawksbills mainly dove in shallow waters (7.6±3.3 m). Less than 5{\%} of the 95{\%} home range area overlapped with the Caletas-Ar{\'{i}}o National Wildlife Refuge. Hawksbills fed mainly on 2 invertebrate species regardless of season: a sponge (Geodia sp.) (mean volume=67{\%}) and a tunicate (Rhopalaea birkelandi) (mean volume=51{\%}). Our surveys along the Nicoya Peninsula suggested that use of rocky reefs by juvenile hawksbill turtles was common. To protect juvenile hawksbills in the study area, we recommend that this site be granted official protection status as part of the Caletas-Ar{\'{i}}o National Wildlife Refuge. We also suggest studying other discrete rocky reefs along the Nicoya Peninsula to determine critical habitats for the hawksbill turtle to improve conservation and management policy. {\textcopyright} Chelonian Research Foundation.},

I tested whether a sympatrically nesting species (Chelonia mydas) also shows the same pattern and found that green turtle seasonal nesting patterns at Canaveral National Seashore, Florida, were unrelated to environmental temperatures at the nesting beach; although, the date of the first nest predicted the magnitude of the nesting season (nesting earlier in the year led to higher numbers of nests). Although the reasons for differences in loggerhead and green turtles remain unclear, these results indicate that the timing of loggerhead turtle nesting may change in a warming environment; whereas, green turtle nesting may remain relatively fixed with regard to temperatures at the nesting beach.},

This technology is advancing our ability to study animal ecology by allowing researchers to (1) answer questions about the physiology, behavior, and ecology of wild animals in situ that would have previously been limited to tests on model organisms in highly controlled settings, (2) study cryptic or wide-ranging animals that have previously evaded investigation, and (3) develop and test entirely new theories. Here we explore how ecologists are using these tools to answer new questions about the physiological performance, energetics, foraging, migration, habitat selection, and sociality of wild animals, as well as collect data on the environments in which they live.},

abstract = {Understanding the spatial ecology of wide-ranging marine species is fundamental to advancing ecological research and species management. For marine turtles, genetic studies using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers have proven invaluable to characterize movement, particularly between rookeries (i.e. nesting sites) and foraging grounds. Hawksbill turtles Eretmochelys imbricata are a globally threatened species whose conservation status is particularly precarious in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Recent research in the region has identified unique life history characteristics, including highly restricted movements, the use of mangrove estuaries for foraging and nesting, as well as a regional pattern of natal foraging philopatry (NFP). For this study, we used mtDNA sequences and mixed-stock analysis of hawksbills from 8 designated foraging grounds and 5 primary rookeries to evaluate stock composition at each foraging ground, assess how stock contributions are affected by the NFP life history strategy, and search for evidence of unidentified rookeries. Although we found evidence supporting the NFP pattern at most foraging grounds, results indicated important site-specific variability at particular foraging grounds. We also found discrepancies among the haplotype frequencies of several foraging grounds and rookeries, as well as the presence of several orphan haplotypes, suggesting undiscovered hawksbill rookeries likely remain in the eastern Pacific. Our findings contextualize the prevalence and scale of the NFP life history strategy and provide insights that can be directly applied to future ecological research and species management and conservation.},

Bio-logging is certain to increase in its importance and to influence the way we study events and processes that are beyond the usual boundaries of perception and that are remote from the observer. It is providing insights into the behaviour and function of organisms in environments that are hostile to the observer and in natural situations. In terms of the way that data are collected it has much in common with remote sensing and Earth observation. This includes post hoc analysis and interpretation of extensive data sets involving a low diversity of measured variables. Owing to the sparseness of data sets, practitioners need to develop better methods of applying the data to models of the organisms being studied. Although increasing technological sophistication is leading to collection of a greater diversity of variables, this also brings complications of interpreting multi-dimension data sets. It appears that technology currently constrains the type of biological questions that can be addressed but there is a danger that technological advancement could result in a loss of focus on hypothesis testing. There is evidence that the discipline of bio-logging is developing a substructure within which specialist teams of modellers, theoretical and field biologists, and engineers collaborate to address complex biological questions.},

abstract = {The processes that drive the ontogeny of migratory strategies in long-lived animals with slow maturation remain enigmatic. While some short-lived migrants are known or believed to repeat the same migratory patterns throughout their lives, little is known on the time required for immature long-lived migrants to progressively acquire adult-like migratory behaviours, or which aspects take longer to refine during the maturation process. Here, we studied the ontogeny of long-distance migratory strategies and related patterns of spatial distribution in a long-lived seabird species during the annual cycle. To do so, we deployed light-level geolocators on 4- to 9-year-old immature Cory's shearwaters (Calonectris borealis) and on breeding adults. We revealed that migratory timings and destinations of young shearwaters progressively changed with age. The effect of ageing was remarkably evident on spring migratory performance and phenology. Birds gradually shortened the duration of the non-breeding period by advancing departure date and reducing travelling time, which resulted in a sequential arrival at the colony of the various age contingents. Ageing immatures gradually changed from a more exploratory strategy to a more conservative way of exploiting resources, reducing both their year-round spatial spread across oceanic domains and the total distance travelled. Immatures always performed a trans-equatorial migration to the Southern Hemisphere, contrasting with 17{\%} of the adults which remained in the North Atlantic year-round. Finally, during the breeding season immatures were widely dispersed through the North Atlantic reducing their overlap with breeding adults. Our long-term study provides empirical support to the hypothesis that in long-lived species, the refinement of migratory behaviour and year-round spatial distribution is a progressive process mediated by age and experience, where life stage constraints and competition for resources may also play a role. The emerging pattern suggests that for some avian taxa, the ontogeny of migratory strategy is a prolonged, complex and dynamic process.},

abstract = {Increased availability of high-resolution movement data has led to the development of numerous methods for studying changes in animal movement behavior. Path segmentation methods provide basics for detecting movement changes and the behavioral mechanisms driving them. However, available path segmentation methods differ vastly with respect to underlying statistical assumptions and output produced. Consequently, it is currently difficult for researchers new to path segmentation to gain an overview of the different methods, and choose one that is appropriate for their data and research questions. Here, we provide an overview of different methods for segmenting movement paths according to potential changes in underlying behavior. To structure our overview, we outline three broad types of research questions that are commonly addressed through path segmentation: 1) the quantitative description of movement patterns, 2) the detection of significant change-points, and 3) the identification of underlying processes or 'hidden states'. We discuss advantages and limitations of different approaches for addressing these research questions using path-level movement data, and present general guidelines for choosing methods based on data characteristics and questions. Our overview illustrates the large diversity of available path segmentation approaches, highlights the need for studies that compare the utility of different methods, and identifies opportunities for future developments in path-level data analysis.},

abstract = {The creation of protected mangrove areas has allowed retaining, at least locally, the increasing urbanization in coastal areas. The physical, chemical and biological spatial dynamics of the aquatic system draining into the Bay of Santa Catarina Island, Southern Brazil, was evaluated to verify the effects of urbanization. A hierarchical design with various spatial scales of samples within urban and non-urban (control) estuaries was used. As control areas, three estuaries situated within protected mangrove areas were chosen. Three other estuaries with environmentally similar features to those of the control ones, except for being located within urban sites, were chosen as anthropogenically-impacted areas. The concentrations of dissolved nutrients, suspended particulate matter and phytoplanktonic biomass were found to be between three to six times greater in urban estuaries than in non-urban ones. The nutrients average concentrations in the non-urban estuaries were 13 ? 3.4 uM for ammonia, 0.5 ? 0.2 uM for nitrite, 6.2 ? 7.5 uM for nitrate, 0.67 ? 0.29 uM for phosphate, and 39.8 ? 19.9 uM for silicate; and in the urban estuaries, theywere72.5?39 uM for ammonia, 3.2? 1.8 uM for nitrite, 14? 13.4 uM for nitrate, 3.32?3.43 uMfor phosphate, and 31.5 ? 21.3 uM for silicate. In urban estuaries, the dissolved inorganic nitrogen was generally three times greater than in non-urban ones, and although the differences in dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were not as high between them, the variations were the greatest. Similarly, chlorophyll-a and phaeophytin-tf presented a higher concentration in urban estuaries (31.1 and 46.4 jug.L {\_}1) than in non-urban ones (15.8 and 26.2 jug.L *), hence the average ratio Chloa:Phaeoa was twice as much in non-urban estuaries. The maintenance of the current mangrove areas, as well as a more efficient control of the domestic and industrial discharges and other activities occurring around the protected areas is suggested as a necessary strategy to maintain the water quality in the Bay of Santa Catarina Island.},

abstract = {Hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), considered Critically Endangered, have several small populations in the Eastern Pacific (EP). Knowledge about their diet and habitat use can aid in developing conservation strategies and promoting population recovery in the region. Although considered a spongivore in the Caribbean, data from the EP region indicate that hawksbills consume a wide array of prey species, including angiosperms. We used two approaches to study the diet of hawksbills at Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica: oesophageal lavage and stable isotope ($\delta$13C, $\delta$15N) analysis of bulk skin tissue and blood plasma. Lavage samples collected from 41 turtles revealed macroalgae as the predominant diet item (Rw = 20.22), followed by sea snails and excavating worms. Stable isotope values for blood plasma from 44 turtles ranged from-23.0‰ to-15.7‰ for $\delta$13C and 6.9‰ to 10.4‰ for $\delta$15N, whereas values for skin tissue were-20.4‰ to-13.9‰ and 9.3‰ to 11.0‰ for $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N, respectively. We compared these isotope values with those of five potential prey groups (sponge, sea snail, excavating worm, mangrove, macroalgae) using a multisource stable isotope mixing model analysis in R (SIAR). Our results indicated that multiple prey resources are important for hawksbills in Golfo Dulce, where sea snails, sponges and excavating worms contributed up to 63{\%} of the assimilated diet per individual, and mangrove and macroalgae up to 50{\%}. These data show that hawksbills in Golfo Dulce, and perhaps the wider EP region, are omnivorous, underscoring the importance for considering alternative habitats, aside of coral reefs, for its management and restoration.},

abstract = {The extent to which prey space use actively minimizes predation risk continues to ignite controversy. Methodological reasons that have hindered consensus include inconsistent measurements of predation risk, biased spatiotemporal scales at which responses are measured and lack of robust null expectations. We addressed all three challenges in a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal responses of adult female elk (Cervus elaphus) to the risk of predation by wolves (Canis lupus) during winter in northern Yellowstone, USA. We quantified spatial overlap between the winter home ranges of GPS-collared elk and three measures of predation risk: the intensity of wolf space use, the distribution of wolf-killed elk and vegetation openness. We also assessed whether elk varied their use of areas characterized by more or less predation risk across hours of the day, and estimated encounter rates between simultaneous elk and wolf pack trajectories. We determined whether observed values were significantly lower than expected if elk movements were random with reference to predation risk using a null model approach. Although a small proportion of elk did show a tendency to minimize use of open vegetation at specific times of the day, overall we highlight a notable absence of spatiotemporal response by female elk to the risk of predation posed by wolves in northern Yellowstone. Our results suggest that predator–prey interactions may not always result in strong spatiotemporal patterns of avoidance.},

abstract = {Variations in environmental parameters (e.g. temperature) that form part of global climate change have been associated with shifts in the timing of sea-sonal events for a broad range of organisms. Most studies evaluating such phenological shifts of individual taxa have focused on a limited number of locations, making it difficult to assess how such shifts vary regionally across a species range. Here, by using 1445 records of the date of first nesting for loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) at different breeding sites, on different continents and in different years across a broad latitudinal range (25 –398 0 N), we demonstrate that the gradient of the relationship between temperature and the date of first breeding is steeper at higher latitudes, i.e. the phenological responses to temperature appear strongest at the pole-ward range limit. These findings support the hypothesis that biological changes in response to climate change will be most acute at the poleward range limits and are in accordance with the predictions of MacArthur's hypothesis that poleward range limit for species range is environmentally limited. Our findings imply that the poleward populations of loggerheads are more sensitive to climate variations and thus they might display the impacts of climate change sooner and more prominently.},

The Cayman Islands aggregation demonstrated a broad size distribution (20.5–62.6 cm straight carapace length), slow growth rate (3.0 6 0.9 cm/y), and multiple recaptures, suggesting long- term residence in some individuals. Demonstrated home range was small (mean distance from capture to recapture 545 6 514 m, range 2–2080 m) although an international tag return suggested a long-range developmental migration. Vertical features provided important habitat in Little Cayman, and larger turtles were generally captured in deeper waters. Behavior at sighting varied by habitat: resting, swimming, and feeding were observed in coral reef, reef wall, and hardbottom colonized by sponges and gorgonians, and resting was frequently observed in uncolonized hardbottom. Images obtained from underwater photographers show that hawksbills forage on sponges and occasionally on jellyfish. We observed an apparent commensal feeding relationship between hawksbills and 3 species of angelfish as well as aggressive interactions between hawksbills. We also documented causes of injury and mortality in the study area— including legal, illegal and incidental take, vessel collisions, hurricanes, and natural predation.},

abstract = {Incubation period, hatching success, and emergence percentage in loggerhead (Caretta caretta) nests were quantified during the 1993 and 1995 nesting seasons and following incubation seasons in Minabe, Wakayama, Japan. Sand and nest temperatures were also monitored. Over the seasons, daily mean sand temperature at nest depth fluctuated between 18.0C and 33.3C, with a steep increase in the second week of July and a peak in late August. Temperatures inside the nest chambers were a few degrees above those of the sur- rounding sand at the end of incubation. The incubation period ranged from 46 to 82 days. A significant negative correlation was found between mean sand temperature and incubation period. The relationship conformed to the day-degree concept. There was no significant sea- sonal trend in hatching success, but many pre-emergent hatchlings were found dead in most of the clutches dur- ing the warmest part of the season. Emergence percent-age was correlated with mean sand temperature calculated for 4 days before emergence, suggesting that mortality may be due to heat. This heat-related mortality is considered to be a common phenomenon at our study site, because the peak in emergences coincides with the peak in high temperatures. These temperature effects on hatchling mortality must be taken into account in esti- mates of hatchling sex ratios. Because sand temperatures already exceed the optimal thermal range for incubation, this population is vulnerable to even small temperature increases resulting from global warming.},

abstract = {We studied the oceanographic and meteorological conditions in four sites related to national parks in the {\'{A}}rea de Conservaci{\'{o}}n Guanacaste. Variables such as temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen were studied through the water column in at least one tidal cycle at three bays Tamarindo, Culebra, Santa Elena located in the North Pacific of Costa Rica, and in Ballena Bay, off the Gulf of Nicoya. At the same time, local wind and ocean currents were measured in order to evaluate the dynamic forces at these sites. Environmental variables around Costa Rica were consulted from operational data sources, such as ocean currents and surface wind patterns, to know the prevailing conditions and their influence. During strong trade winds, a typical dry season condition, strong ocean currents are generated in front of the Nicoya Peninsula. This is consistent with the prevailing oceanographic conditions offshore Papagayo Gulf when the wind jet is established. These external forces influence the ocean circulation of open water bays, as was observed in Tamarindo Bay. The local wind and tide are components that modulate local circulation, especially in closed bays like Santa Elena and Ballena. The stratified current structure of the water layers in Ballena Bay showed a typical estuarine condition with the presence of different thermohaline fields dominated by tidal forces.},

abstract = {A goal of animal movement analysis is to reveal behavioural mechanisms by which organisms utilize complex and variable environments. Statistical analysis of movement data is complicated by the fact that the data are multidimensional, autocorrelated and often marked by error and irregular measurement intervals or gappiness. Furthermore, movement data reflect behaviours that are themselves heterogeneous. Here, we model movement data as a subsampling of a continuous stochastic processes, and introduce the behavioural change point analysis (BCPA), a likelihood-based method that allows for the identification of significant structural changes. The BCPA is robust to gappiness and measurement error, computationally efficient, easy to implement and reveals structure that is otherwise difficult to discern. We apply the analysis to a GPS movement track of a northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), revealing an unexpectedly complex diurnal behavioural profile, and demonstrate its robustness to the greater errors associated with the ARGOS tracking system. By informing empirical interpretation of movement data, we suggest that the BCPA can eventually motivate the development of mechanistic behavioural models. {\textcopyright}2009 Blackwell Publishing LtdCNRS.},

abstract = {Animal populations are often comprised of both foraging specialists and generalists. For instance, some individuals show higher foraging site fidelity (spatial specialization) than others. Such individual differences in degree of specialization can persist over time-scales of months or even years in long-lived animals, but the mechanisms leading to these different individual strategies are not fully understood. There is accumulating evidence that individual variation in foraging behaviour is shaped by animal personality traits, such as boldness. Despite this, the potential for boldness to drive differences in the degree of specialization is unknown. In this study, we used novel object tests to measure boldness in black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) breeding at four colonies in Svalbard and deployed GPS loggers to examine their at-sea foraging behaviour. We estimated the repeatability of foraging trips and used a hidden Markov model to identify locations of foraging sites in order to quantify individual foraging site fidelity. Across the breeding season, bolder birds were more repeatable than shy individuals in the distance and range of their foraging trips, and during the incubation period (but not chick rearing), bolder individuals were more site-faithful. Birds exhibited these differences while showing high spatial similarity in foraging areas, indicating that site selection was not driven by personality-dependent spatial partitioning. We instead suggest that a relationship between boldness and site fidelity may be driven by differences in behavioural flexibility between bold and shy individuals. Together, these results provide a potential mechanism by which widely reported individual differences in foraging specialization may emerge.},

abstract = {How animal movement decisions interact with the distribution of resources to shape individual performance is a key question in ecology. However, links between spatial and behavioural ecology and fitness consequences are poorly understood because the outcomes of individual resource selection decisions, such as energy intake, are rarely measured. In the open ocean, mesoscale features (approx. 10–100 km) such as fronts and eddies can aggregate prey and thereby drive the distribution of foraging vertebrates through bottom-up biophysical coupling. These productive features are known to attract predators, yet their role in facilitating energy transfer to top-level consumers is opaque. We investigated the use of mesoscale features by migrating northern elephant seals and quantified the corresponding energetic gains from the seals' foraging patterns at a daily resolution. Migrating elephant seals modified their diving behaviour and selected for mesoscale features when foraging. Daily energy gain increased significantly with increasing mesoscale activity, indicating that the physical environment can influence predator fitness at fine temporal scales. Results show that areas of high mesoscale activity not only attract top predators as foraging hotspots, but also lead to increased energy transfer across trophic levels. Our study provides evidence that the physical environment is an important factor in controlling energy flow to top predators by setting the stage for variation in resource availability. Such understanding is critical for assessing how changes in the environment and resource distribution will affect individual fitness and food web dynamics.},

abstract = {Biologging devices are used ubiquitously across vertebrate taxa in studies of movement and behavioural ecology to record data from organisms without the need for direct observation. Despite the dramatic increase in the sophistication of this technology, progress in reducing the impact of these devices to animals is less obvious, notwithstanding the implications for animal welfare. Existing guidelines focus on tag weight (e.g. the ‘5{\%} rule'), ignoring aero/hydrodynamic forces in aerial and aquatic organisms, which can be considerable. Designing tags to minimize such impact for animals moving in fluid environments is not trivial, as the impact depends on the position of the tag on the animal, as well as its shape and dimensions. We demonstrate the capabilities of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling to optimize the design and positioning of biologgers on marine animals, using the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) as a model species. Specifically, we investigate the effects of (a) tag form, (b) tag size, and (c) tag position and quantify the impact under frontal hydrodynamic forces, as encountered by seals swimming at sea. By comparing a conventional versus a streamlined tag, we show that the former can induce up to 22{\%} larger drag for a swimming seal; to match the drag of the streamlined tag, the conventional tag would have to be reduced in size by 50{\%}. For the conventional tag, the drag induced can differ by up to 11{\%} depending on the position along the seal's body, whereas for the streamlined tag this difference amounts to only 5{\%}. We conclude by showing how the CFD simulation approach can be used to optimize tag design to reduce drag for aerial and aquatic species, including issues such as the impact of lateral currents (unexplored until now). We also provide a step-by-step guide to facilitate the implementation of CFD in biologging tag design.},

Interannual variation was greatest in the green turtle. When comparing green and loggerhead turtles nesting in Cyprus we found that green turtles were more likely to change the interval between laying seasons and showed greater variation in the number of clutches laid in a season. We suggest that these di¡erences are driven by the varying trophic statuses of the different species. Green turtles are herbivorous, feeding on sea grasses and macro-algae, and this primary production will be more tightly coupled with prevailing environmental conditions than the carnivorous diet of the loggerhead turtle.},

In order to do this we combined published data from existing flipper tagging and early satellite tracking studies with data from an additional 12 satellite tracked green turtles (1996-2006). Three of these were tracked from their foraging grounds in the Gulf of California along the east coast of the Baja California peninsula to their breeding grounds in Michoac{\'{a}}n (1337-2928 km). In addition, three post-nesting females were satellite tracked from Colola beach, Michoac{\'{a}}n to their foraging grounds in southern Mexico and Central America (941.3-3020 km). A further six turtles were tracked in the Gulf of California within their foraging grounds giving insights into the scale of ranging behaviour. Turtles undertaking long-distance migrations showed a tendency to follow the coastline. Turtles tracked within foraging grounds showed that foraging individuals typically ranged up to 691.6 km (maximum) from release site location. Additionally, we carried out threat analysis (using the cumulative global human impact in the Eastern Pacific) clustering pre-existing satellite tracking studies from Galapagos, Costa Rica, and data obtained from this study; this indicated that turtles foraging and nesting in Central American waters are subject to the highest anthropogenic impact. Considering that turtles from all three rookeries were found to migrate towards Central America, it is highly important to implement conservation plans in Central American coastal areas to ensure the survival of the remaining green turtles in the Eastern Pacific. Finally, by combining satellite tracking data from this and previous studies, and data of tag returns we created the best available distributional patterns for this particular sea turtle species, which emphasized that conservation measures in key areas may have positive consequences on a regional scale.},

abstract = {Bio-logging has emerged as a tool in animal biology much as genomics has emerged as a tool in the study of cellular and organ function. Bio-logging is certain to increase in its importance and to influence the way we study events and processes that are beyond the usual boundaries of perception and that are remote from the observer. It is providing insights into the behaviour and function of organisms in environments that are hostile to the observer and in natural situations. In terms of the way that data are collected it has much in common with remote sensing and Earth observation. This includes post hoc analysis and interpretation of extensive data sets involving a low diversity of measured variables. Owing to the sparseness of data sets, practitioners need to develop better methods of applying the data to models of the organisms being studied. Although increasing technological sophistication is leading to collection of a greater diversity of variables, this also brings complications of interpreting multi-dimension data sets. It appears that technology currently constrains the type of biological questions that can be addressed but there is a danger that technological advancement could result in a loss of focus on hypothesis testing. There is evidence that the discipline of bio-logging is developing a substructure within which specialist teams of modellers, theoretical and field biologists, and engineers collaborate to address complex biological questions.},

A few years later Meier and Staffelbach demonstrated a special technique, usually referred to as fast correlation attacks, that is very effective if the feedback polynomial has a special form, namely, if its weight is very low. Due to this seminal result, it is a well known fact that one avoids low weight feedback polynomials in the design of LFSR based stream ciphers. This paper identifies a new class of such weak feedback polynomials, polynomials of the form f(x) = g 1 (x)+g 2 (x)x M1 + ... + g t (x)x Mt-1 , where g 1 ,g 2 ,...,g t are all polynomials of low degree. For such feedback polynomials, we identify an efficient correlation attack in the form of a distinguishing attack. {\textcopyright}International Association for Cryptologic Research 2004.},

abstract = {A resource selection function is a model of the likelihood that an available spatial unit will be used by an animal, given its resource value. But how do we appropriately define availability? Step selection analysis deals with this problem at the scale of the observed positional data, by matching each 'used step' (connecting two consecutive observed positions of the animal) with a set of 'available steps' randomly sampled from a distribution of observed steps or their characteristics. Here we present a simple extension to this approach, termed integrated step selection analysis (iSSA), which relaxes the implicit assumption that observed movement attributes (i.e. velocities and their temporal autocorrelations) are independent of resource selection. Instead, iSSA relies on simultaneously estimating movement and resource selection parameters, thus allowing simple likelihood-based inference of resource selection within a mechanistic movement model. We provide theoretical underpinning of iSSA, as well as practical guidelines to its implementation. Using computer simulations, we evaluate the inferential and predictive capacity of iSSA compared to currently used methods. Our work demonstrates the utility of iSSA as a general, flexible and user-friendly approach for both evaluating a variety of ecological hypotheses, and predicting future ecological patterns.},

While it is widely accepted that once marine turtles reach sexual maturity they home to natal areas for nesting or reproduction, the role of philopatry to natal areas during other life stages has received less scrutiny, despite widespread evidence across the taxa. Here we report on genetic research that indicates that juvenile hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) in the eastern Pacific Ocean use foraging grounds in the region of their natal beaches, a pattern we term natal foraging philopatry. Our findings confirm that traditional views of natal homing solely for reproduction are incomplete and that many marine turtle species exhibit philopatry to natal areas to forage. Our results have important implications for life-history research and conservation of marine turtles and may extend to other wide-rangingmarine vertebrates that demonstrate natal philopatry.},

Although tri-axial accelerometers are increasingly employed for this purpose, their application in smallbodied animals has been limited by weight restrictions. Additionally, accelerometers engender novel complications, as a system is needed to reliably map acceleration to behaviors. In this study, we describe newly developed, tiny acceleration-logging devices (1.5-2.5 g) and use them to characterize behavior in two chipmunk species. We collected paired accelerometer readings and behavioral observations from captive individuals. We then employed techniques from machine learning to develop an automatic system for coding accelerometer readings into behavioral categories.Finally,we deployed and recovered accelerometers from free-living, wild chipmunks. This is the first time to our knowledge that accelerometers have been used to generate behavioral data for small-bodied ({\textless}100 g), free-living mammals.},

abstract = {Robust evidence exists that certain extreme weather and climate events, especially daily temperature and precipitation extremes, have changed in regard to intensity and frequency over recent decades. These changes have been linked to human-induced climate change, while the degree to which climate change impacts an individual extreme climate event (ECE) is more difficult to quantify. Rapid progress in event attribution has recently been made through improved understanding of observed and simulated climate variability, methods for event attribution and advances in numerical modelling. Attribution for extreme temperature events is stronger compared with other event types, notably those related to the hydrological cycle. Recent advances in the understanding of ECEs, both in observations and their representation in state-of-the-art climate models, open new opportunities for assessing their effect on human and natural systems. Improved spatial resolution in global climate models and advances in statistical and dynamical downscaling now provide climatic information at appropriate spatial and temporal scales. Together with the continued development of Earth System Models that simulate biogeochemical cycles and interactions with the biosphere at increasing complexity, these make it possible to develop a mechanistic understanding of how ECEs affect biological processes, ecosystem functioning and adaptation capabilities. Limitations in the observational network, both for physical climate system parameters and even more so for long-term ecological monitoring, have hampered progress in understanding bio-physical interactions across a range of scales. New opportunities for assessing how ECEs modulate ecosystem structure and functioning arise from better scientific understanding of ECEs coupled with technological advances in observing systems and instrumentation.

abstract = {Statisticians frequently voice concern that their interactions with applied researchers start only after data have been collected. The same can be said for our experience with home-range studies. Too often, conversations about home range begin with questions concerning estimation methods, smoothing parameters, or the nature of autocorrelation. More productive efforts start by asking good (and interesting) research questions; once these questions are defined, it becomes possible to ask how various design and analysis strategies influence one's ability to answer these questions. With this process in mind, we address key sample-design and data-analysis issues related to the topic of home range. The impact of choosing a particular home-range estimator (e.g., minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimator, or local convex hull) will be question dependent, and for some problems other movement or use-based metrics (e.g., mean step lengths or time spent in particular areas) may be worthy of consideration. Thus, we argue the need for more question-driven and focused research and for clearly distinguishing the biological concept of an animal's home range from the statistical quantities one uses to investigate this concept. For comparative studies, it is important to standardize sampling regimes and estimation methods as much as possible, and to pay close attention to missing data issues. More attention should also be given to temporally changing space-use patterns, with biologically meaningful time periods (e.g., life-history stages) used to define sampling periods. Last, we argue the need for closer connections between theoretical and empirical researchers. Advances in ecological theory, and its application to natural resources management, will require carefully designed research studies to test theoretical predictions from more mechanistic modeling approaches. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Society of Mammalogists.},

abstract = {Acoustic telemetry is a popular tool for long-term tracking of aquatic animals to describe and quantify patterns of movement, space use, and diverse ecological interactions. Acoustic receivers are imperfect sampling instruments, and their detection range (DR; the area surrounding the receiver in which tag transmissions can be detected) often varies dramatically over space and time due to dynamic environmental conditions. Therefore, it is prudent to quantify and account for variation in DR to prevent telemetry system performance from confounding the understanding of real patterns in animal space use. However, acoustic receiver DR consists of a complex, dynamic, three-dimensional area that is challenging to quantify. Although quantifying the absolute DR of all receivers is infeasible in the context of most acoustic telemetry studies, we outline a practical approach to quantify relative variation among receiver DR over space and time. This approach involves selecting a set of sentinel receivers to monitor drivers of variation in detection range. Each sentinel receiver is subject to a range testing procedure to estimate detection efficiency (DE; the proportion of total transmissions detected by the receiver), at a range of distances from the receiver, to derive the maximum range (MR; distance from the receiver where DE is 5{\%}) and Midpoint (distance from the receiver where DE is 50{\%}). A reference transmitter is then placed at the Midpoint, providing a standardized measure of long-term variation in DE, with each station having similar freedom of variance. Variation in reference tag DE is then combined with MR to calculate a DR correction factor (DRc). A modelling approach is then used to estimate DRc for all receivers in the array at spatial and temporal scales of ecological interest, which can be used to correct animal detection data in various ways. We demonstrate this method with a hypothetical dataset, as well as empirical data from an acoustic telemetry array to delineate spatio-temporal patterns of fish habitat use. This is a flexible and practical approach to account for variation in acoustic receiver performance, allowing more accurate spatial and temporal patterns in aquatic animal spatial ecology to be revealed.},

abstract = {Many animals, including sea turtles, alter their movements and home range in relation to the particular type and quality of the habitat occupied. When sufficient resources are available, individuals may develop affinities to specific areas for activities, such as foraging and (or) resting. In the case of green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas L.), after a number of years in the open ocean, juveniles recruit to shallow-water developmental habitats where they occupy distinct home ranges as they feed and grow to maturity. Our goal was to study the habitat use and home range movements of juvenile green turtles along a shallow, worm-rock reef tract in Palm Beach, Florida. Six turtles, measuring from 27.9 to 48.1 cm in straight carapace length and from 7.2 to 12.6 kg in mass, were tracked via ultrasonic telemetry from August to November 2003. Upon capture, each turtle's esophagus was flushed via lavage to determine recently ingested foods. In addition, four turtles were recaptured and fitted with a time-depth recorder to study dive patterns. Home range areas measured with 100{\%} minimum convex polygon and 95{\%} fixed kernel estimators varied from 0.69 to 5.05 km2 (mean=2.38±1.78 km2) and 0.73 to 4.89 km2 (mean=2.09±1.80 km2), respectively. Home ranges and core areas of turtles were largely restricted to the reef tract itself, and showed considerable overlap between food and shelter sites. The mean number of dives during daylight hours (0600– 1800 hours) was 84±5.0 dives, while the mean during night hours (1800–0600 hours) was 39±3.0 dives. Dives during the day were shallower (mean=3.20±1.26 m) than dives at night (mean=5.59±0.09 m). All six turtles were found to have a mixed diet of similar macroalgae and sponge fragments. Our results reveal that juvenile green turtles occupy stable home ranges along the nearshore worm-rock reefs of Southeast Florida, during the summer and fall. Determining which habitats are used by green turtles will assist conservation managers in their global effort to protect this endangered species.},

abstract = {1. The paradigm-changing opportunities of bio-logging sensors for ecological research, especially movement ecology, are vast, but the crucial questions of how best to match the most appropriate sensors and sensor combinations to specific biological questions, and how to analyse complex bio-logging data, are mostly ignored. 2. Here, we fill this gap by reviewing how to optimise the use of bio-logging techniques to answer questions in movement ecology and synthesise this into an Integrated Bio-logging Framework (IBF). 3. We highlight that multi-sensor approaches are a new frontier in bio-logging, whilst identifying current limitations and avenues for future development in sensor technology.4. We focus on the importance of efficient data exploration, and more advanced multi-dimensional visualisation methods, combined with appropriate archiving and sharing approaches, to tackle the big data issues presented by bio-logging. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities in matching the peculiarities of specific sensor data to the statistical models used, highlighting at the same time the large advances which will be required in the latter to properly analyse bio-logging data. 5. Taking advantage of the bio-logging revolution will require a large improvement in the theoretical and mathematical foundations of movement ecology, to include the rich set of high-frequency multivariate data, which greatly expand the fundamentally limited and coarse data that could be collected using location-only technology such as GPS. Equally important will be the establishment of multi-disciplinary collaborations to catalyse the opportunities offered by current and future bio-logging technology. If this is achieved, clear potential exists for developing a vastly improved mechanistic understanding of animal movements and their roles in ecological processes, and for building realistic predictive models.},

abstract = {In the past decade, ecologists have witnessed vast improvements in our ability to collect animal movement data through animal-borne technology, such as through GPS or ARGOS systems. However, more data does not necessarily yield greater knowledge in understanding animal ecology and conservation. In this paper, we provide a review of the major benefits, problems and potential misuses of GPS/Argos technology to animal ecology and conservation. Benefits are obvious, and include the ability to collect fine-scale spatio-temporal location data on many previously impossible to study animals, such as ocean-going fish, migratory songbirds and long-distance migratory mammals. These benefits come with significant problems, however, imposed by frequent collar failures and high cost, which often results in weaker study design, reduced sample sizes and poorer statistical inference. In addition, we see the divorcing of biologists from a field-based understanding of animal ecology to be a growing problem. Despite these difficulties, GPS devices have provided significant benefits, particularly in the conservation and ecology of wide-ranging species. We conclude by offering suggestions for ecologists on which kinds of ecological questions would currently benefit the most from GPS/Argos technology, and where the technology has been potentially misused. Significant conceptual challenges remain, however, including the links between movement and behaviour, and movement and population dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {A common challenge in species conservation and management is how to incorporate species movements into management objectives. There often is a lack of knowledge of where, when, and why species move. The field of movement ecology has grown rapidly in the last decade and is now providing the knowledge needed to incorporate movements of species into management planning. This knowledge can also be used to develop management strategies that are flexible in time and space and may improve the effectiveness of management actions. Therefore, wildlife management and conservation may benefit by strengthening the link with movement ecology. We present a framework that illustrates how animal movement can be used to enhance conservation planning and identify management actions that are complementary to existing strategies. The framework contains five steps that identify (1) the movement attributes of a species, (2) their impacts on ecosystems, (3) how this knowledge can be used to guide the scale and type of management, (4) the implementation, and (5) the evaluation of management actions. We discuss these five steps in detail, highlighting why the step is important and how the information can be obtained. We illustrate the framework through a case study of managing a highly mobile species, the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), a harvested species of conservation concern. We believe that the movement-management framework provides an important, and timely, link between movement ecology and wildlife management and conservation, and highlights the potential for complementary, dynamic solutions for managing wildlife.},

abstract = {Integrating biomechanics, behavior and ecology requires a mechanistic understanding of the processes producing the movement of animals. This calls for contemporaneous biomechanical, behavioral and environmental data along movement pathways. A recently formulated unifying movement ecology paradigm facilitates the integration of existing biomechanics, optimality, cognitive and random paradigms for studying movement. We focus on the use of tri-axial acceleration (ACC) data to identify behavioral modes of GPS-tracked free-ranging wild animals and demonstrate its application to study the movements of griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus, Hablizl 1783). In particular, we explore a selection of nonlinear and decision tree methods that include support vector machines, classification and regression trees, random forest methods and artificial neural networks and compare them with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a baseline for classifying behavioral modes. Using a dataset of 1035 groundtruthed ACC segments, we found that all methods can accurately classify behavior (80–90{\%}) and, as expected, all nonlinear methods outperformed LDA. We also illustrate how ACC-identified behavioral modes provide the means to examine how vulture flight is affected by environmental factors, hence facilitating the integration of behavioral, biomechanical and ecological data. Our analysis of just over three-quarters of a million GPS and ACC measurements obtained from 43 free-ranging vultures across 9783 vulture-days suggests that their annual breeding schedule might be selected primarily in response to seasonal conditions favoring rising-air columns (thermals) and that rare long-range forays of up to 1750km from the home range are performed despite potentially heavy energetic costs and a low rate of food intake, presumably to explore new breeding, social and long-term resource location opportunities.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Sea turtles are migratory animals that travel from foraging grounds to specific nesting beaches every few years and that, therefore, can be influenced by oceanographic conditions in several different habitats. We assessed how sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-{\$}\alpha{\$} (Chl-{\$}\alpha{\$}) within both internesting and foraging areas influence the nesting abundance, phenology and duration of internesting periods of the green turtles (Chelonia mydas) that nest at Cabuyal, Northwest Costa Rica. Specifically, we compared (1) SST and Chl-{\$}\alpha{\$} in foraging areas to the nesting abundance and median nesting date (MND) registered on the beach over seven nesting seasons and (2) SST in internesting habitats to the observed internesting period (OIP) (number of days between successful nesting events) and the MND. Nesting abundance was strongly correlated to Chl-{\$}\alpha{\$} concentrations at the main foraging area during the February preceding the nesting season. However, we found no significant effect of SST or Chl-{\$}\alpha{\$} in either foraging or internesting habitats on the MND. Mean SST values in the internesting habitats and OIP were negatively correlated and were highly variable both between and within years. Oceanographic conditions appear to strongly influence OIP and nesting abundance, but not the nesting phenology of green turtles in this area. The complex nature of the effect of oceanographic conditions on reproduction of the East Pacific green turtle suggests uncertainty in how this species will respond to climate change.},

However, regional projections do not always match global projections and species with global distributions may exhibit varying regional susceptibility to climate change. Here we show the effect of local climatic conditions on the hatchling output of leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) at four nesting sites encompassing the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. We found a heterogeneous effect of climate. Hatchling output increased with long-term precipitation in areas with dry climatic conditions (Playa Grande, Pacific Ocean and Sandy Point, Caribbean Sea), but the effect varied in areas where precipitation was high (Pacuare, Caribbean Sea) and was not detected at the temperate site (Maputaland, Indian Ocean). High air temperature reduced hatchling output only at the area experiencing seasonal droughts (Playa Grande). Climatic projections showed a drastic increase in air temperature and a mild decrease in precipitation at all sites by 2100. The most unfavorable conditions were projected for Sandy Point where hatching success has already declined over time along with precipitation levels. The heterogeneous effect of climate may lead to local extinctions of leatherback turtles in some areas but survival in others by 2100.},

abstract = {Popular frameworks for studying habitat selection include resource-selection functions (RSFs) and step-selection functions (SSFs), estimated using logistic and conditional logistic regression, respectively. Both frameworks compare environmental covariates associated with locations animals visit with environmental covariates at a set of locations assumed available to the animals. Conceptually, slopes that vary by individual, that is, random coefficient models, could be used to accommodate inter-individual heterogeneity with either approach. While fitting such models for RSFs is possible with standard software for generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs), straightforward and efficient one-step procedures for fitting SSFs with random coefficients are currently lacking. To close this gap, we take advantage of the fact that the conditional logistic regression model (i.e. the SSF) is likelihood-equivalent to a Poisson model with stratum-specific fixed intercepts. By interpreting the intercepts as a random effect with a large (fixed) variance, inference for random-slope models becomes feasible with standard Bayesian techniques, or with frequentist methods that allow one to fix the variance of a random effect. We compare this approach to other commonly applied alternatives, including models without random slopes and mixed conditional regression models fit using a two-step algorithm. Using data from mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) and Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra), we illustrate that our models lead to valid and feasible inference. In addition, we conduct a simulation study to compare different estimation approaches for SSFs and to demonstrate the importance of including individual-specific slopes when estimating individual- and population-level habitat-selection parameters. By providing coded examples using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) and Template Model Builder (TMB) for Bayesian and frequentist analysis via the R packages R-INLA and glmmTMB, we hope to make efficient estimation of RSFs and SSFs with random effects accessible to anyone in the field. SSFs with individual-specific coefficients are particularly attractive since they can provide insights into movement and habitat-selection processes at fine-spatial and temporal scales, but these models had previously been very challenging to fit.},

abstract = {Animal populations are often comprised of both foraging specialists and generalists. For instance, some individuals show higher foraging site fidelity (spatial specialization) than others. Such individual differences in degree of specialization can persist over time-scales of months or even years in long-lived animals, but the mechanisms leading to these different individual strategies are not fully understood. There is accumulating evidence that individual variation in foraging behaviour is shaped by animal personality traits, such as boldness. Despite this, the potential for boldness to drive differences in the degree of specialization is unknown. In this study, we used novel object tests to measure boldness in black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) breeding at four colonies in Svalbard and deployed GPS loggers to examine their at-sea foraging behaviour. We estimated the repeatability of foraging trips and used a hidden Markov model to identify locations of foraging sites in order to quantify individual foraging site fidelity. Across the breeding season, bolder birds were more repeatable than shy individuals in the distance and range of their foraging trips, and during the incubation period (but not chick rearing), bolder individuals were more site-faithful. Birds exhibited these differences while showing high spatial similarity in foraging areas, indicating that site selection was not driven by personality-dependent spatial partitioning. We instead suggest that a relationship between boldness and site fidelity may be driven by differences in behavioural flexibility between bold and shy individuals. Together, these results provide a potential mechanism by which widely reported individual differences in foraging specialization may emerge.},

abstract = {Humans, as super predators, can have strong effects on wildlife behaviour, including profound modifications of diel activity patterns. Subsequent to the return of large carnivores to human-modified ecosystems, many prey species have adjusted their spatial behaviour to the contrasting landscapes of fear generated by both their natural predators and anthropogenic pressures. The effects of predation risk on temporal shifts in diel activity of prey, however, remain largely unexplored in human-dominated landscapes. We investigated the influence of the density of lynx Lynx lynx, a nocturnal predator, on the diel activity patterns of their main prey, the roe deer Capreolus capreolus, across a gradient of human disturbance and hunting at the European scale. Based on 11 million activity records from 431 individually GPS-monitored roe deer in 12 populations within the EURODEER network (http://eurodeer.org), we investigated how lynx predation risk in combination with both lethal and non-lethal human activities affected the diurnality of deer. We demonstrated marked plasticity in roe deer diel activity patterns in response to spatio-temporal variations in risk, mostly due to human activities. In particular, roe deer decreased their level of diurnality by a factor of 1.37 when the background level of general human disturbance was high. Hunting exacerbated this effect, as during the hunting season deer switched most of their activity to night-time and, to a lesser extent, to dawn, although this pattern varied noticeably in relation to lynx density. Indeed, in the presence of lynx, their main natural predator, roe deer were relatively more diurnal. Overall, our results revealed a strong influence of human activities and the presence of lynx on diel shifts in roe deer activity. In the context of the recovery of large carnivores across Europe, we provide important insights about the effects of predators on the behavioural responses of their prey in human-dominated ecosystems. Modifications in the temporal partitioning of ungulate activity as a response to human activities may facilitate human–wildlife coexistence, but likely also have knock-on effects for predator–prey interactions, with cascading effects on ecosystem functioning.},

Green sea turtles (GSTs) Chelonia mydas are an ectothermic species observed inhabiting 2 sites with AAWT at the northern point of their geographical range in the eastern Pacific. An acoustic receiver array was deployed with temperature loggers at the San Gabriel River, Long Beach, CA, where 2 power plants discharge warm water into the river, and at the 7th St. Basin, Seal Beach, CA, a dredged shallow basin with warmer water compared to surrounding coastal habitats during the summer months. Juvenile GSTs (n = 22, straight carapace length = 45.2 to 96.8 cm) were tagged with acoustic transmitters. Turtles in the basin migrated into the river during winter months when temperatures dropped below 15°C. During the winter, turtles were most frequently detected at the river receiver stations adjacent to and downstream of the power plants. This suggests that GSTs use the warm effluent as a thermal refuge, avoiding colder areas upstream of the power plants and near the river mouth. In the summer, turtles were most frequently detected at receiver stations upstream of the power plants, potentially exploiting areas of the river with higher primary productivity. AAWT sustain the northernmost aggregation of GSTs in the eastern Pacific year round; however, based on GST thermal tolerance, this population is expected to change their movement patterns when the power plants discontinue discharging warm water by 2029.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the mechanisms influencing phenology can provide insights into the adaptability of species to climate change. Here, we investigated the factors influencing multidecadal trends in the nesting phenology of the leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea at Playa Grande, Costa Rica, in the eastern Pacific Ocean and at Sandy Point, US Virgin Islands, in the western Atlantic Ocean. Between 1993 and 2013, the median nesting date (MND) at Playa Grande occurred later, at a rate of [approximately]0.3 d yr-1. In contrast, between 1982 and 2010, the MND at Sandy Point occurred earlier, at a rate of [approximately]0.17 d yr-1. The opposing trends in the MND of each population were not explained by variation in the multivariate El Nino-Southern Oscillation index, North Atlantic Oscillation index, or Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index; however, the MND at Playa Grande was significantly correlated with nesting population size. We propose that changes in demography, linked to the population decline at Playa Grande, and the population recovery at Sandy Point may explain the contrasting trends in MNDs. If the observed trends in MND continue into the future, the nesting season at Playa Grande will coincide with increasingly adverse conditions for hatching success, exacerbating the already detrimental effects of climate change. Alternatively, shifts in the nesting phenology may make the Atlantic populations more resilient to climate change. Our findings highlight the increasing need for conservation efforts for eastern Pacific leatherback turtles to consider climate change mitigation practices.},

abstract = {Acoustic telemetry is a popular tool for long-term tracking of aquatic animals to describe and quantify patterns of movement, space use, and diverse ecological interactions. Acoustic receivers are imperfect sampling instruments, and their detection range (DR; the area surrounding the receiver in which tag transmissions can be detected) often varies dramatically over space and time due to dynamic environmental conditions. Therefore, it is prudent to quantify and account for variation in DR to prevent telemetry system performance from confounding the understanding of real patterns in animal space use. However, acoustic receiver DR consists of a complex, dynamic, three-dimensional area that is challenging to quantify. Although quantifying the absolute DR of all receivers is infeasible in the context of most acoustic telemetry studies, we outline a practical approach to quantify relative variation among receiver DR over space and time. This approach involves selecting a set of sentinel receivers to monitor drivers of variation in detection range. Each sentinel receiver is subject to a range testing procedure to estimate detection efficiency (DE; the proportion of total transmissions detected by the receiver), at a range of distances from the receiver, to derive the maximum range (MR; distance from the receiver where DE is 5{\%}) and Midpoint (distance from the receiver where DE is 50{\%}). A reference transmitter is then placed at the Midpoint, providing a standardized measure of long-term variation in DE, with each station having similar freedom of variance. Variation in reference tag DE is then combined with MR to calculate a DR correction factor (DRc). A modelling approach is then used to estimate DRc for all receivers in the array at spatial and temporal scales of ecological interest, which can be used to correct animal detection data in various ways.

abstract = {Leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) have declined dramatically in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EP) in recent decades. Traditionally, population assessments have relied on the numbers of turtles on the beaches with the highest abundance of turtles (index beaches) and often disregarded the importance of nesting beaches with smaller, but still regular, numbers of nesting turtles (secondary beaches). We characterize leatherback nesting on secondary beaches throughout Pacific Costa Rica. Nesting distribution was significantly reduced since the 1990s and it currently appears to be constricted to the Santa Elena and Nicoya peninsulas. Over the past five years, nesting abundance on secondary beaches was low, ranging between 0.4 ± 0.5 and 5.3 ± 1.5 females and 3.8 ± 5.2 and 22.8 ± 10.8 nests per beach and per year. There was some exchange of turtles between beaches. The exchange rate (percentage of females that nested at least once on a different beach) ranged between 7{\%} and 28{\%}. While Caletas still registers multiple clutches that are laid by 1-2 females in some years, it may no longer qualify as a secondary beach due to the infrequent nature of nesting events registered recently and the total absence of nests in some of those years. Although nesting abundance is relatively low at secondary beaches, they host at least {\~{}}25{\%} of total leatherback nesting abundance in Costa Rica. As the EP leatherback turtle declines, not only do the numbers of nesting turtles decrease but local extirpations are occurring on, previously categorized, secondary beaches. The critically low number of turtles at present may prevent recolonization of sites where they have been extirpated.},

abstract = {The timing and strength of wind-driven coastal upwelling along the eastern margins of major ocean basins regulate the productivity of critical fisheries and marine ecosystems by bringing deep and nutrient-rich waters to the sunlit surface, where photosynthesis can occur. How coastal upwelling regimes might change in a warming climate is therefore a question of vital importance. Although enhanced land-ocean differential heating due to greenhouse warming has been proposed to intensify coastal upwelling by strengthening alongshore winds, analyses of observations and previous climate models have provided little consensus on historical and projected trends in coastal upwelling. Here we show that there are strong and consistent changes in the timing, intensity and spatial heterogeneity of coastal upwelling in response to future warming in most Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUSs). An ensemble of climate models shows that by the end of the twenty-first century the upwelling season will start earlier, end later and become more intense at high but not low latitudes. This projected increase in upwelling intensity and duration at high latitudes will result in a substantial reduction of the existing latitudinal variation in coastal upwelling. These patterns are consistent across three of the four EBUSs (Canary, Benguela and Humboldt, but not California). The lack of upwelling intensification and greater uncertainty associated with the California EBUS may reflect regional controls associated with the atmospheric response to climate change. Given the strong linkages between upwelling and marine ecosystems, the projected changes in the intensity, timing and spatial structure of coastal upwelling may influence the geographical distribution of marine biodiversity.},

abstract = {Satellite telemetry from 26 loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and 10 olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) sea turtles captured and released from pelagic longline fishing gear provided information on the turtles' position and movement in the central North Pacific. These data together with environmental data from satellite remote sensing are used to describe the oceanic habitat used by these turtles. The results indicate that loggerheads travel westward, move seasonally north and south primarily through the region 28–40N, and occupy sea surface temperatures (SST) of 15–25C. Their dive depth distribution indicated that they spend 40{\%} of their time at the surface and 90{\%} of their time at depths {\textless}40 m. Loggerheads are found in association with fronts, eddies, and geostrophic currents. Specifically, the Transition Zone Chlorophyll Front (TZCF) and the southern edge of the Kuroshio Extension Current (KEC) appear to be important forage and migration habitats for loggerheads. In contrast, olive ridleys were found primarily south of loggerhead habitat in the region 8–31N latitude, occupying warmer water with SSTs of 23– 28C. They have a deeper dive pattern than loggerheads, spending only 20{\%} of their time at the surface and 60{\%} shallower than 40 m. However, the three olive ridleys identified from genetics to be of western Pacific origin spent some time associated with major ocean currents, specifically the southern edge of the KEC, the North Equatorial Current (NEC), and the Equatorial Counter Current (ECC). These habitats were not used by any olive ridleys of eastern Pacific origin suggesting that olive ridleys from different populations may occupy different oceanic habitats.},

abstract = {Ecological niche theory predicts sympatric species to show segregation in their spatio-temporal habitat utilization or diet as a strategy to avoid competition. Similarly, within species individuals may specialize on specific dietary resources or foraging habitats. Such individual specialization seems to occur particularly in environments with predictable resource distribution and limited environmental variability. Still, little is known about how seasonal environmental variability affects segregation of resources within species and between closely related sympatric species. The aim of the study was to investigate the foraging behaviour of three closely related and sympatrically breeding fulmarine petrels (Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica, cape petrels Daption capense and southern fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides) in a seasonally highly variable environment (Prydz Bay, Antarctica) with the aim of assessing inter- and intraspecific overlap in utilized habitat, timing of foraging and diet and to identify foraging habitat preferences. We used GPS loggers with wet/dry sensors to assess spatial habitat utilization over the entire breeding season. Trophic overlap was investigated using stable isotope analysis based on blood, feathers and egg membranes. Foraging locations were identified using wet/dry data recorded by the GPS loggers and expectation-maximization binary clustering. Foraging habitat preferences were modelled using generalized additive models and model cross-validation. During incubation and chick-rearing, the utilization distribution of all three species overlapped significantly and species also overlapped in the timing of foraging during the day—partly during incubation and completely during chick-rearing. Isotopic centroids showed no significant segregation between at least two species for feathers and egg membranes, and among all species during incubation (reflected by blood). Within species, there was no individual specialization in foraging sites or environmental space. Furthermore, no single environmental covariate predicted foraging activity along trip trajectories. Instead, best-explanatory environmental covariates varied within and between individuals even across short temporal scales, reflecting a highly generalist behaviour of birds. Our results may be explained by optimal foraging theory. In the highly productive but spatio-temporally variable Antarctic environment, being a generalist may be key to finding mobile prey—even though this increases the potential for competition within and among sympatric species.},

This research examined the influence of sampling frequency (1–25 Hz) with tri-axial accelerometer biologgers on estimates of overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), tail-beat frequency, swimming speed and metabolic rate of bonefish Albula vulpes in a swim-tunnel respirometer and free-swimming in a wetland mesocosm. In the swim tunnel, sampling frequencies of ≥ 5 Hz were sufficient to establish strong relationships between ODBA, swimming speed and metabolic rate. However, in free-swimming bonefish, estimates of metabolic rate were more variable below 10 Hz. Sampling frequencies should be at least twice the maximum tail-beat frequency to estimate this metric effectively, which is generally higher than those required to estimate ODBA, swimming speed and metabolic rate. While optimal sampling frequency probably varies among species due to tail-beat frequency and swimming style, this study provides a reference point with a medium body-sized sub-carangiform teleost fish, enabling researchers to measure these metrics effectively and maximize study duration.},

We describe a number of extensions of HMMs for animal movement modeling, including more flexible state transition models and individual random effects (fitted in a non-Bayesian framework). In particular we consider so-called hidden semi-Markov models, which may substantially improve the goodness of fit and provide important insights into the behavioral state switching dynamics.

Here, we present two new non-invasive methods for deploying satellite and biologging tags on pelagic sharks and rays that do not require restraining or manipulation of the animals, nor the attachment of intramuscular anchors. The attachment of a modified fin clamp and a harness systems were tested on 12 blue sharks and four devil rays in the Azores, mid-north Atlantic. Clamps and harnesses were fitted with galvanic timed releases and deployed manually by a free diver or from the boat using a harness tagging pole. The tags remained on the animals over the entire short-term duration of the trials. Focal observations and deployment data suggest that both methods produce little or no adverse behavioural reaction on the animals, offering a valid alternative for short-term tagging of pelagic sharks and rays. Deployment length can be substantially increased by selecting longer duration galvanic timed releases.},

There often is a lack of knowledge of where, when, and why species move. The field of movement ecology has grown rapidly in the last decade and is now providing the knowledge needed to incorporate movements of species into management planning. This knowledge can also be used to develop management strategies that are flexible in time and space and may improve the effectiveness of management actions. Therefore, wildlife management and conservation may benefit by strengthening the link with movement ecology. We present a framework that illustrates how animal movement can be used to enhance conservation planning and identify management actions that are complementary to existing strategies. The framework contains five steps that identify (1) the movement attributes of a species, (2) their impacts on ecosystems, (3) how this knowledge can be used to guide the scale and type of management, (4) the implementation, and (5) the evaluation of management actions. We discuss these five steps in detail, highlighting why the step is important and how the information can be obtained. We illustrate the framework through a case study of managing a highly mobile species, the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), a harvested species of conservation concern. We believe that the movement-management framework provides an important, and timely, link between movement ecology and wildlife management and conservation, and highlights the potential for complementary, dynamic solutions for managing wildlife.},

Methodological reasons that have hindered consensus include inconsistent measurements of predation risk, biased spatiotemporal scales at which responses are measured and lack of robust null expectations. We addressed all three challenges in a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal responses of adult female elk (Cervus elaphus) to the risk of predation by wolves (Canis lupus) during winter in northern Yellowstone, USA. We quantified spatial overlap between the winter home ranges of GPS-collared elk and three measures of predation risk: the intensity of wolf space use, the distribution of wolf-killed elk and vegetation openness. We also assessed whether elk varied their use of areas characterized by more or less predation risk across hours of the day, and estimated encounter rates between simultaneous elk and wolf pack trajectories. We determined whether observed values were significantly lower than expected if elk movements were random with reference to predation risk using a null model approach. Although a small proportion of elk did show a tendency to minimize use of open vegetation at specific times of the day, overall we highlight a notable absence of spatiotemporal response by female elk to the risk of predation posed by wolves in northern Yellowstone. Our results suggest that predator–prey interactions may not always result in strong spatiotemporal patterns of avoidance.},

The method is equivalent to a short-term center of activity rather than a precise estimate of location at a single time. The utility of the method was assessed using data from a study of neonate blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus). Periods between 5 and 60 min were tested to find the most appropriate interval for estimating positions. The results from the method agreed closely with a simulated shark track and data from actively tracked sharks. The median distances between successive locations from the mean-position algorithm were between 28{\%} and 42{\%} of those from active tracking because of the center-of-activity nature of the method.

abstract = {Modeling animal movements is fundamental to animal ecology as it provides the foundation for further exploration into mechanisms affecting individual and population-level processes. In the last few decades, biotelemetry has enabled scientists to track the movements of marine life across a variety of scales. However, the use of such technology is progressing faster than the analytical techniques for modeling movement patterns. In summer 2012, we deployed an acoustic telemetry array around Culebra, Puerto Rico, consisting of 48 remote receivers that can detect coded transmissions sent by tags implanted in fish. We surgically implanted transmitters in bonefish ( n= 28), great barracuda ( n= 2) and permit ( n= 1) as part of a multi-year study. In January 2013, we downloaded over 850,000 detections from 39 receivers for 31 fish (several receivers had zero fish detections, and two receivers were not downloaded), and used that six-month data set to explore how graph theory and network analysis can be used to model the movement ecology of the tagged fish. We analyzed this data as two types of graphs. First, a bipartite graph was constructed by linking each fish with an edge weighted by the number of detections of that fish by that receiver. Bipartite graphs are not explicitly spatial, but rather represent which fish associate with which receivers. Second, spatial movement graphs for individuals were built by linking receivers (nodes) by edges with the number of times each fish moved along that edge as weights. The bipartite graph identified groups of fish visiting the same sites, and groups of sites visited by the same fish. Of the six community detection algorithms used, Multilevel, Fast-Greedy, and Walk-Trap performed best, with similar module partitions and modularity scores. All three of these algorithms produced modules (groups) that appear to reflect working hypotheses related to the coastal bathymetry, habitat types, and associated movement ecology of the tagged species. Spatial movement graphs were very different for each fish examined and reflect behavioral differences. Fish exhibited various movement patterns, some showing the pattern of a central place forager (bonefish), while others cruised along a territory (great barracuda and permit).},

abstract = {GPS-tracking devices have been used in combination with a wide range of additional sensors to study animal behaviour, physiology and interaction with their environment. Tri-axial accelerometers allow researchers to remotely infer the behaviour of individuals, at all places and times. Collection of accelerometer data is relatively cheap in terms of energy usage, but the amount of raw data collected generally requires much storage space and is particularly demanding in terms of energy needed for data transmission. Here, we propose compressing the raw accelerometer (ACC) data into summary statistics within the tracking device (before transmission) to reduce data size, as a means to overcome limitations in storage and energy capacity. We explored this type of lossy data compression in the accelerometer data of tagged Bewick's swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii collected in spring 2017. Using software settings in which bouts of 2 s of both raw ACC data and summary statistics were collected in parallel but with different bout intervals to keep total data size comparable, we created the opportunity for a direct comparison of time budgets derived by the two data collection methods. We found that the data compression in our case yielded a six times reduction in data size per bout, and concurrent, similar decreases in storage and energy use of the device. We show that with the same accuracy of the behavioural classification, the freed memory and energy of the device can be used to increase the monitoring effort, resulting in a more detailed representation of the individuals' time budget. Rare and/or short behaviours, such as daily roost flights, were picked up significantly more when collecting summary statistics instead of raw ACC data (but note differences in sampling rate). Such level of detail can be of essential importance, for instance to make a reliable estimate of the energy budgets of individuals. In conclusion, we argue that this type of lossy data compression can be a well-considered choice in study situations where limitations in energy and storage space of the device pose a problem. Ultimately, these developments can allow for long-term and nearly continuous remote monitoring of the behaviour of free-ranging animals.},

abstract = {The paradigm-changing opportunities of biologging sensors for ecological research, especially movement ecology, are vast, but the crucial questions of how best to match the most appropriate sensors and sensor combinations to specific biological questions and how to analyse complex biologging data, are mostly ignored. Here, we fill this gap by reviewing how to optimize the use of biologging techniques to answer questions in movement ecology and synthesize this into an Integrated Biologging Framework (IBF). We highlight that multisensor approaches are a new frontier in biologging, while identifying current limitations and avenues for future development in sensor technology. We focus on the importance of efficient data exploration, and more advanced multidimensional visualization methods, combined with appropriate archiving and sharing approaches, to tackle the big data issues presented by biologging. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities in matching the peculiarities of specific sensor data to the statistical models used, highlighting at the same time the large advances which will be required in the latter to properly analyse biologging data. Taking advantage of the biologging revolution will require a large improvement in the theoretical and mathematical foundations of movement ecology, to include the rich set of high-frequency multivariate data, which greatly expand the fundamentally limited and coarse data that could be collected using location-only technology such as GPS. Equally important will be the establishment of multidisciplinary collaborations to catalyse the opportunities offered by current and future biologging technology. If this is achieved, clear potential exists for developing a vastly improved mechanistic understanding of animal movements and their roles in ecological processes and for building realistic predictive models.},

abstract = {The evolution and improvement of novel applications on acoustic telemetry technology are driven mainly by the need to address more complex behavioral, ecological and physiological questions. A new Vemco VR2W Positioning System (VPS) is described and tested here using an array of 16 VR2W acoustic monitoring receivers and 8 fixed synchronizing transmitters. VPS positioning algorithm is based on the 3-receiver time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) algorithm used by the existing Vemco VRAP system, extended to work with an array of three or more receivers that do not have synchronized clocks. The positional accuracy and performance of the VPS was estimated on a stationary and a slow-moving coded transmitter, and on two free-swimming elasmobranch species. Mean positional accuracy (±SD) of VPS estimates from a stationary transmitter deployed at several locations within the receiver array was 2.64 ± 2.32. m. Positional error was significantly lower inside (2.13 ± 1.31. m) than outside the array (5.12 ± 4.11. m; p{\textless} 0001). There were no significant differences in positional accuracy between stationary and moving tests (4.09 ± 2.53. m; p= 0.067). Furthermore, home range estimates and movement parameters of two elasmobranch species tracked simultaneously with VPS and active tracking were statistically similar (p{\textgreater} 0.05). Our results suggest that the positional accuracy of the VPS is comparable to active tracking; however, researchers must consider specific environmental and biological variables when using the VPS. Additionally, the number, layout and proximity of acoustic receivers and synchronizing transmitters can improve considerably the performance of the VPS. The VPS provides a more efficient, less expensive approach to study and quantify fine-scale, long-term movements and habitat use of multiple individuals simultaneously, with the potential for improving our understanding on ecological and behavioral population level processes in aquatic environments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Passive acoustic telemetry provides an important tool to study the spatial ecology and behaviour of organisms in marine and freshwater systems, but understanding the detection range of acoustic receivers is critical for interpreting acoustic data and establishing receiver spacing to maximize study efficiency. This study presents a comprehensive review of how acoustic detection range has been considered and assessed to date, summarizes important variables to monitor when determining the detection range of a receiver array, and provides recommendations to account for detection range during experimental design, analysis and data interpretation. A total of 378 passive acoustic telemetry studies (1986-2012) were scored against a set of pre-defined criteria to provide a standardized assessment of how well detection range was accounted for, from a maximum possible score of 45. Scores ranged from 0 to 39 (11.1 ± 0.4; mean ± 1 SE). Over the past decade mean scores have been consistently between 6.7 and 12.9 which indicates that detection range has not been adequately considered in most contemporary acoustic telemetry studies. Given the highly variable nature of detection range over space and time, it is necessary to create a culture of detection range testing among the scientific community. For robust telemetry studies it is recommended that consideration of detection range should be given a greater focus within study design, execution and data analysis. To aid array design in new systems, short-term detection range tests should be conducted in the most representative area of the study system prior to deployment. As well, fixed distance sentinel tags should ideally be deployed at a representative receiver site within the array to provide a continuous assessment of detection range and influential environmental parameters should be monitored to facilitate modeling of detection range variability over time. When warranted, data analysis should incorporate modeled variation in detection ranges. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Electronic tags (both biotelemetry and biologging platforms) have informed conservation and resource management policy and practice by providing vital information on the spatial ecology of animals and their environments. However, the extent of the contribution of biological sensors (within electronic tags) that measure an animal's state (e.g., heart rate, body temperature, and details of locomotion and energetics) is less clear. A literature review revealed that, despite a growing number of commercially available state sensor tags and enormous application potential for such devices in animal biology, there are relatively few examples of their application to conservation. Existing applications fell under 4 main themes: quantifying disturbance (e.g., ecotourism, vehicular and aircraft traffic), examining the effects of environmental change (e.g., climate change), understanding the consequences of habitat use and selection, and estimating energy expenditure. We also identified several other ways in which sensor tags could benefit conservation, such as determining the potential efficacy of management interventions. With increasing sensor diversity of commercially available platforms, less invasive attachment techniques, smaller device sizes, and more researchers embracing such technology, we suggest that biological sensor tags be considered a part of the necessary toolbox for conservation. This approach can measure (in real time) the state of free-ranging animals and thus provide managers with objective, timely, relevant, and accurate data to inform policy and decision making.},

abstract = {Currently, the deployment of tracking devices is one of the most frequently used approaches to study movement ecology of birds. Recent miniaturization of light-level geolocators enabled studying small bird species whose migratory patterns were widely unknown. However, geolocators may reduce vital rates in tagged birds and may bias obtained movement data. There is a need for a thorough assessment of the potential tag effects on small birds, as previous meta-analyses did not evaluate unpublished data and impact of multiple life-history traits, focused mainly on large species and the number of published studies tagging small birds has increased substantially. We quantitatively reviewed 549 records extracted from 74 published and 48 unpublished studies on over 7,800 tagged and 17,800 control individuals to examine the effects of geolocator tagging on small bird species (body mass {\textless}100 g). We calculated the effect of tagging on apparent survival, condition, phenology and breeding performance and identified the most important predictors of the magnitude of effect sizes. Even though the effects were not statistically significant in phylogenetically controlled models, we found a weak negative impact of geolocators on apparent survival. The negative effect on apparent survival was stronger with increasing relative load of the device and with geolocators attached using elastic harnesses. Moreover, tagging effects were stronger in smaller species. In conclusion, we found a weak effect on apparent survival of tagged birds and managed to pinpoint key aspects and drivers of tagging effects. We provide recommendations for establishing matched control group for proper effect size assessment in future studies and outline various aspects of tagging that need further investigation. Finally, our results encourage further use of geolocators on small bird species but the ethical aspects and scientific benefits should always be considered.},

abstract = {The performance of an array of data-logging single frequency acoustic receivers in the Caloosahatchee River (Florida, USA) was examined and the results incorporated into a positioning algorithm for animals tracked within the system. The mean code detection efficiency across all individual receivers and all download periods was 0.414 detections per synchronization code. On average, the code rejection coefficient was approximately 4{\%}, indicating that it was only a minor factor in reducing code detection efficiency. There were significant performance differences between stations and download periods, but no interaction between these two factors for all three metrics. Code detection efficiency, the rejection coefficient, and the noise quotient all showed significant variations with distance from the river mouth and time since deployment. Comparison of position estimates with and without efficiency produced small differences for bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) and cownose rays (Rhinoptera bonasus) monitored via this system. Root mean square errors were higher for cownose rays (48 m) than for bull sharks (23 m). Mean differences for individuals were always slightly downstream because of the increasing code detection efficiency of upriver receivers. The results of this comparison indicated that the inclusion of code detection efficiency did not significantly improve the results of the positioning algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2008 NRC.},

abstract = {Popular frameworks for studying habitat selection include resource-selection functions (RSFs) and step-selection functions (SSFs), estimated using logistic and conditional logistic regression, respectively. Both frameworks compare environmental covariates associated with locations animals visit with environmental covariates at a set of locations assumed available to the animals. Conceptually, slopes that vary by individual, that is, random coefficient models, could be used to accommodate inter-individual heterogeneity with either approach. While fitting such models for RSFs is possible with standard software for generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMMs), straightforward and efficient one-step procedures for fitting SSFs with random coefficients are currently lacking. To close this gap, we take advantage of the fact that the conditional logistic regression model (i.e. the SSF) is likelihood-equivalent to a Poisson model with stratum-specific fixed intercepts. By interpreting the intercepts as a random effect with a large (fixed) variance, inference for random-slope models becomes feasible with standard Bayesian techniques, or with frequentist methods that allow one to fix the variance of a random effect. We compare this approach to other commonly applied alternatives, including models without random slopes and mixed conditional regression models fit using a two-step algorithm. Using data from mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) and Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra), we illustrate that our models lead to valid and feasible inference. In addition, we conduct a simulation study to compare different estimation approaches for SSFs and to demonstrate the importance of including individual-specific slopes when estimating individual- and population-level habitat-selection parameters. By providing coded examples using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) and Template Model Builder (TMB) for Bayesian and frequentist analysis via the R packages R-INLA and glmmTMB, we hope to make efficient estimation of RSFs and SSFs with random effects accessible to anyone in the field. SSFs with individual-specific coefficients are particularly attractive since they can provide insights into movement and habitat-selection processes at fine-spatial and temporal scales, but these models had previously been very challenging to fit.},

abstract = {A goal of animal movement analysis is to reveal behavioural mechanisms by which organisms utilize complex and variable environments. Statistical analysis of movement data is complicated by the fact that the data are multidimensional, autocorrelated and often marked by error and irregular measurement intervals or gappiness. Furthermore, movement data reflect behaviours that are themselves heterogeneous. Here, we model movement data as a subsampling of a continuous stochastic processes, and introduce the behavioural change point analysis (BCPA), a likelihood-based method that allows for the identification of significant structural changes. The BCPA is robust to gappiness and measurement error, computationally efficient, easy to implement and reveals structure that is otherwise difficult to discern. We apply the analysis to a GPS movement track of a northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus), revealing an unexpectedly complex diurnal behavioural profile, and demonstrate its robustness to the greater errors associated with the ARGOS tracking system. By informing empirical interpretation of movement data, we suggest that the BCPA can eventually motivate the development of mechanistic behavioural models. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing LtdCNRS.},

abstract = {Ecological niche theory predicts sympatric species to show segregation in their spatio-temporal habitat utilization or diet as a strategy to avoid competition. Similarly, within species individuals may specialize on specific dietary resources or foraging habitats. Such individual specialization seems to occur particularly in environments with predictable resource distribution and limited environmental variability. Still, little is known about how seasonal environmental variability affects segregation of resources within species and between closely related sympatric species. The aim of the study was to investigate the foraging behaviour of three closely related and sympatrically breeding fulmarine petrels (Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica, cape petrels Daption capense and southern fulmars Fulmarus glacialoides) in a seasonally highly variable environment (Prydz Bay, Antarctica) with the aim of assessing inter- and intraspecific overlap in utilized habitat, timing of foraging and diet and to identify foraging habitat preferences. We used GPS loggers with wet/dry sensors to assess spatial habitat utilization over the entire breeding season. Trophic overlap was investigated using stable isotope analysis based on blood, feathers and egg membranes. Foraging locations were identified using wet/dry data recorded by the GPS loggers and expectation-maximization binary clustering. Foraging habitat preferences were modelled using generalized additive models and model cross-validation. During incubation and chick-rearing, the utilization distribution of all three species overlapped significantly and species also overlapped in the timing of foraging during the day—partly during incubation and completely during chick-rearing. Isotopic centroids showed no significant segregation between at least two species for feathers and egg membranes, and among all species during incubation (reflected by blood). Within species, there was no individual specialization in foraging sites or environmental space. Furthermore, no single environmental covariate predicted foraging activity along trip trajectories. Instead, best-explanatory environmental covariates varied within and between individuals even across short temporal scales, reflecting a highly generalist behaviour of birds. Our results may be explained by optimal foraging theory.

abstract = {Acoustic telemetry is a popular tool for long-term tracking of aquatic animals to describe and quantify patterns of movement, space use, and diverse ecological interactions. Acoustic receivers are imperfect sampling instruments, and their detection range (DR; the area surrounding the receiver in which tag transmissions can be detected) often varies dramatically over space and time due to dynamic environmental conditions. Therefore, it is prudent to quantify and account for variation in DR to prevent telemetry system performance from confounding the understanding of real patterns in animal space use. However, acoustic receiver DR consists of a complex, dynamic, three-dimensional area that is challenging to quantify. Although quantifying the absolute DR of all receivers is infeasible in the context of most acoustic telemetry studies, we outline a practical approach to quantify relative variation among receiver DR over space and time. This approach involves selecting a set of sentinel receivers to monitor drivers of variation in detection range. Each sentinel receiver is subject to a range testing procedure to estimate detection efficiency (DE; the proportion of total transmissions detected by the receiver), at a range of distances from the receiver, to derive the maximum range (MR; distance from the receiver where DE is 5{\%}) and Midpoint (distance from the receiver where DE is 50{\%}). A reference transmitter is then placed at the Midpoint, providing a standardized measure of long-term variation in DE, with each station having similar freedom of variance. Variation in reference tag DE is then combined with MR to calculate a DR correction factor (DRc). A modelling approach is then used to estimate DRc for all receivers in the array at spatial and temporal scales of ecological interest, which can be used to correct animal detection data in various ways. We demonstrate this method with a hypothetical dataset, as well as empirical data from an acoustic telemetry array to delineate spatio-temporal patterns of fish habitat use. This is a flexible and practical approach to account for variation in acoustic receiver performance, allowing more accurate spatial and temporal patterns in aquatic animal spatial ecology to be revealed.},

IACUCs may, however, lack the knowledge and experience to evaluate fish projects judiciously, especially when the projects are in field settings. Surgeries involving implantation of transmitters and other instruments into the coelom, which now comprise a very common research tool in the study of free-ranging fishes, are examples of surgeries that use a broad spectrum of surgical and anesthetic techniques, some of which would not be considered acceptable for similar work on mammals. IACUCs should apply the standards they would expect to be used for surgeries on homeotherms to surgeries on fish. Surgeons should be carefully trained and experienced. Surgical instruments and transmitters should be sterile. Regulations and laws on the use of drugs in animals should be followed, particularly those concerned with anesthetics and antibiotics used on free-ranging fish.

abstract = {Modeling animal movements is fundamental to animal ecology as it provides the foundation for further exploration into mechanisms affecting individual and population-level processes. In the last few decades, biotelemetry has enabled scientists to track the movements of marine life across a variety of scales. However, the use of such technology is progressing faster than the analytical techniques for modeling movement patterns. In summer 2012, we deployed an acoustic telemetry array around Culebra, Puerto Rico, consisting of 48 remote receivers that can detect coded transmissions sent by tags implanted in fish. We surgically implanted transmitters in bonefish ( n= 28), great barracuda ( n= 2) and permit ( n= 1) as part of a multi-year study. In January 2013, we downloaded over 850,000 detections from 39 receivers for 31 fish (several receivers had zero fish detections, and two receivers were not downloaded), and used that six-month data set to explore how graph theory and network analysis can be used to model the movement ecology of the tagged fish. We analyzed this data as two types of graphs. First, a bipartite graph was constructed by linking each fish with an edge weighted by the number of detections of that fish by that receiver. Bipartite graphs are not explicitly spatial, but rather represent which fish associate with which receivers. Second, spatial movement graphs for individuals were built by linking receivers (nodes) by edges with the number of times each fish moved along that edge as weights. The bipartite graph identified groups of fish visiting the same sites, and groups of sites visited by the same fish. Of the six community detection algorithms used, Multilevel, Fast-Greedy, and Walk-Trap performed best, with similar module partitions and modularity scores. All three of these algorithms produced modules (groups) that appear to reflect working hypotheses related to the coastal bathymetry, habitat types, and associated movement ecology of the tagged species. Spatial movement graphs were very different for each fish examined and reflect behavioral differences. Fish exhibited various movement patterns, some showing the pattern of a central place forager (bonefish), while others cruised along a territory (great barracuda and permit).},

abstract = {Biologging devices are used ubiquitously across vertebrate taxa in studies of movement and behavioural ecology to record data from organisms without the need for direct observation. Despite the dramatic increase in the sophistication of this technology, progress in reducing the impact of these devices to animals is less obvious, notwithstanding the implications for animal welfare. Existing guidelines focus on tag weight (e.g. the ‘5{\%} rule'), ignoring aero/hydrodynamic forces in aerial and aquatic organisms, which can be considerable. Designing tags to minimize such impact for animals moving in fluid environments is not trivial, as the impact depends on the position of the tag on the animal, as well as its shape and dimensions. We demonstrate the capabilities of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling to optimize the design and positioning of biologgers on marine animals, using the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) as a model species. Specifically, we investigate the effects of (a) tag form, (b) tag size, and (c) tag position and quantify the impact under frontal hydrodynamic forces, as encountered by seals swimming at sea. By comparing a conventional versus a streamlined tag, we show that the former can induce up to 22{\%} larger drag for a swimming seal; to match the drag of the streamlined tag, the conventional tag would have to be reduced in size by 50{\%}. For the conventional tag, the drag induced can differ by up to 11{\%} depending on the position along the seal's body, whereas for the streamlined tag this difference amounts to only 5{\%}. We conclude by showing how the CFD simulation approach can be used to optimize tag design to reduce drag for aerial and aquatic species, including issues such as the impact of lateral currents (unexplored until now). We also provide a step-by-step guide to facilitate the implementation of CFD in biologging tag design.},

abstract = {The processes that drive the ontogeny of migratory strategies in long-lived animals with slow maturation remain enigmatic. While some short-lived migrants are known or believed to repeat the same migratory patterns throughout their lives, little is known on the time required for immature long-lived migrants to progressively acquire adult-like migratory behaviours, or which aspects take longer to refine during the maturation process. Here, we studied the ontogeny of long-distance migratory strategies and related patterns of spatial distribution in a long-lived seabird species during the annual cycle. To do so, we deployed light-level geolocators on 4- to 9-year-old immature Cory's shearwaters (Calonectris borealis) and on breeding adults. We revealed that migratory timings and destinations of young shearwaters progressively changed with age. The effect of ageing was remarkably evident on spring migratory performance and phenology. Birds gradually shortened the duration of the non-breeding period by advancing departure date and reducing travelling time, which resulted in a sequential arrival at the colony of the various age contingents. Ageing immatures gradually changed from a more exploratory strategy to a more conservative way of exploiting resources, reducing both their year-round spatial spread across oceanic domains and the total distance travelled. Immatures always performed a trans-equatorial migration to the Southern Hemisphere, contrasting with 17{\%} of the adults which remained in the North Atlantic year-round. Finally, during the breeding season immatures were widely dispersed through the North Atlantic reducing their overlap with breeding adults. Our long-term study provides empirical support to the hypothesis that in long-lived species, the refinement of migratory behaviour and year-round spatial distribution is a progressive process mediated by age and experience, where life stage constraints and competition for resources may also play a role. The emerging pattern suggests that for some avian taxa, the ontogeny of migratory strategy is a prolonged, complex and dynamic process.},

abstract = {Movement is important to all organisms, and accordingly it is addressed in a huge number of papers in the literature. Of nearly 26,000 papers referring to movement, an estimated 34{\%} focused on movement by measuring it or testing hypotheses about it. This enormous amount of information is difficult to review and highlights the need to assess the collective completeness of movement studies and identify gaps. We surveyed 1,000 randomly selected papers from 496 journals and compared the facets of movement studied with a suggested framework for movement ecology, consisting of internal state (motivation, physiology), motion and navigation capacities, and external factors (both the physical environment and living organisms), and links among these components. Most studies simply measured and described the movement of organisms without reference to ecological or internal factors, and the most frequently studied part of the framework was the link between external factors and motion capacity. Few studies looked at the effects on movement of navigation capacity, or internal state, and those were mainly from vertebrates. For invertebrates and plants most studies were at the population level, whereas more vertebrate studies were conducted at the individual level. Consideration of only population-level averages promulgates neglect of between-individual variation in movement, potentially hindering the study of factors controlling movement. Terminology was found to be inconsistent among taxa and subdisciplines. The gaps identified in coverage of movement studies highlight research areas that should be addressed to fully understand the ecology of movement. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

In recent years the development of small microprocessor-based data storage tags that are surgically implanted or satellite-linked provide marine researchers a novel avenue for examining the movements, physiology and behaviors of pelagic animals in the wild. When biological and physical data obtained from the tags are combined with satellite derived sea surface temperature and ocean color data, the relationships between the movements, behaviors and physical ocean environment can be examined. Tag-bearing marine animals can function as autonomous ocean profilers providing oceanographic data wherever their long migrations take them. The biologging science is providing ecological physiologists with new insights into the seasonal movements, habitat utilization, breeding behaviors and population structures in of marine vertebrates. In addition, the data are revealing migration corridors, hot spots and physical oceanographic patterns that are key to understanding how organisms such as bluefin tunas use the open ocean environment. In the 21st century as ecosystem degradation and global warming continue to threaten the existence of species on Earth, the field of physiological ecology will play a more pivotal role in conservation biology.},

abstract = {Passive acoustic telemetry provides an important tool to study the spatial ecology and behaviour of organisms in marine and freshwater systems, but understanding the detection range of acoustic receivers is critical for interpreting acoustic data and establishing receiver spacing to maximize study efficiency. This study presents a comprehensive review of how acoustic detection range has been considered and assessed to date, summarizes important variables to monitor when determining the detection range of a receiver array, and provides recommendations to account for detection range during experimental design, analysis and data interpretation. A total of 378 passive acoustic telemetry studies (1986-2012) were scored against a set of pre-defined criteria to provide a standardized assessment of how well detection range was accounted for, from a maximum possible score of 45. Scores ranged from 0 to 39 (11.1 ± 0.4; mean ± 1 SE). Over the past decade mean scores have been consistently between 6.7 and 12.9 which indicates that detection range has not been adequately considered in most contemporary acoustic telemetry studies. Given the highly variable nature of detection range over space and time, it is necessary to create a culture of detection range testing among the scientific community. For robust telemetry studies it is recommended that consideration of detection range should be given a greater focus within study design, execution and data analysis. To aid array design in new systems, short-term detection range tests should be conducted in the most representative area of the study system prior to deployment. As well, fixed distance sentinel tags should ideally be deployed at a representative receiver site within the array to provide a continuous assessment of detection range and influential environmental parameters should be monitored to facilitate modeling of detection range variability over time. When warranted, data analysis should incorporate modeled variation in detection ranges. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Here, we fill this gap by reviewing how to optimize the use of biologging techniques to answer questions in movement ecology and synthesize this into an Integrated Biologging Framework (IBF). We highlight that multisensor approaches are a new frontier in biologging, while identifying current limitations and avenues for future development in sensor technology. We focus on the importance of efficient data exploration, and more advanced multidimensional visualization methods, combined with appropriate archiving and sharing approaches, to tackle the big data issues presented by biologging. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities in matching the peculiarities of specific sensor data to the statistical models used, highlighting at the same time the large advances which will be required in the latter to properly analyse biologging data. Taking advantage of the biologging revolution will require a large improvement in the theoretical and mathematical foundations of movement ecology, to include the rich set of high-frequency multivariate data, which greatly expand the fundamentally limited and coarse data that could be collected using location-only technology such as GPS. Equally important will be the establishment of multidisciplinary collaborations to catalyse the opportunities offered by current and future biologging technology. If this is achieved, clear potential exists for developing a vastly improved mechanistic understanding of animal movements and their roles in ecological processes and for building realistic predictive models.},

However, more data does not necessarily yield greater knowledge in understanding animal ecology and conservation. In this paper, we provide a review of the major benefits, problems and potential misuses of GPS/Argos technology to animal ecology and conservation. Benefits are obvious, and include the ability to collect fine-scale spatio-temporal location data on many previously impossible to study animals, such as ocean-going fish, migratory songbirds and long-distance migratory mammals. These benefits come with significant problems, however, imposed by frequent collar failures and high cost, which often results in weaker study design, reduced sample sizes and poorer statistical inference. In addition, we see the divorcing of biologists from a field-based understanding of animal ecology to be a growing problem. Despite these difficulties, GPS devices have provided significant benefits, particularly in the conservation and ecology of wide-ranging species. We conclude by offering suggestions for ecologists on which kinds of ecological questions would currently benefit the most from GPS/Argos technology, and where the technology has been potentially misused. Significant conceptual challenges remain, however, including the links between movement and behaviour, and movement and population dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Recent advances in biologging open promising perspectives in the study of animal movements at numerous scales. It is now possible to record time series of animal locations and ancillary data (e.g. activity level derived from on-board accelerometers) over extended areas and long durations with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Such time series are often piecewise stationary, as the animal may alternate between different stationary phases (i.e. characterized by a specific mean and variance of some key parameter for limited periods). Identifying when these phases start and end is a critical first step to understand the dynamics of the underlying movement processes. We introduce a new segmentation-clustering method we called segclust2d (available as a r package at cran.r-project.org/package=segclust2d). It can segment bivariate (or more generally multivariate) time series and possibly cluster the various segments obtained, corresponding to different phases assumed to be stationary. This method is easy to use, as it only requires specifying a minimum segment length (to prevent over-segmentation), based on biological rather than statistical considerations. This method can be applied to bivariate piecewise time series of any nature. We focus here on two types of time series related to animal movement, corresponding to (a) at large scale, series of bivariate coordinates of relocations, to highlight temporary home ranges, and (b) at smaller scale, bivariate series derived from relocations data, such as speed and turning angle, to highlight different behavioural modes such as transit, feeding and resting. Using computer simulations, we show that segclust2d can rival and even outperform previous, more complex methods, which were specifically developed to highlight changes of movement modes or home range shifts (based on hidden Markov and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck modelling), which, contrary to our method, usually require the user to provide relevant initial guesses to be efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate it on actual examples involving a zebra's small-scale movements and an elephant's large-scale movements, to illustrate how various movement modes and home range shifts, respectively, can be identified.},

In parallel, sophisticated tools have been developed to process, visualize and analyse tracking data; however, many of these tools have proliferated in isolation, making it challenging for users to select the most appropriate method for the question in hand. Indeed, within the r software alone, we listed 58 packages created to deal with tracking data or ‘tracking packages'. Here, we reviewed and described each tracking package based on a workflow centred around tracking data (i.e. spatio-temporal locations (x, y, t)), broken down into three stages: pre-processing, post-processing and analysis, the latter consisting of data visualization, track description, path reconstruction, behavioural pattern identification, space use characterization, trajectory simulation and others. Supporting documentation is key to render a package accessible for users. Based on a user survey, we reviewed the quality of packages' documentation and identified 11 packages with good or excellent documentation. Links between packages were assessed through a network graph analysis. Although a large group of packages showed some degree of connectivity (either depending on functions or suggesting the use of another tracking package), one third of the packages worked in isolation, reflecting a fragmentation in the r movement-ecology programming community. Finally, we provide recommendations for users when choosing packages, and for developers to maximize the usefulness of their contribution and strengthen the links within the programming community.},

abstract = {The recent introduction of low-cost, moored data-logging acoustic receivers has provided opportunities for tracking marine organisms over small (hundreds of metres) and large scales (hundreds of kilometres). Acoustic receivers have been deployed in many different environments to examine specific hypotheses regarding the movement of aquatic species. This technology provides many advantages for studying aquatic animal movement patterns, but also has limitations and provides unique difficulties for users. Study design, applications, advantages and limitations are discussed with examples from past and current studies. Data management and analysis techniques are in their infancy and few standardised techniques exist. Complications with data management and potential data analysis techniques are discussed. Examples from the literature are utilised wherever possible to provide useful references. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2006.},

@article{Wilmers2015a,
abstract = {Great leaps forward in scientific understanding are often spurred by innovations in technology. The explosion of miniature sensors that are driving the boom in consumer electronics, such as smart phones, gaming platforms, and wearable fitness devices, are now becoming available to ecologists for remotely monitoring the activities of wild animals. While half a century ago researchers were attaching balloons to the backs of seals to measure their movement, today ecologists have access to an arsenal of sensors that can continuously measure most aspects of an animal's state (e.g., location, behavior, caloric expenditure, interactions with other animals) and external environment (e.g., temperature, salinity, depth). This technology is advancing our ability to study animal ecology by allowing researchers to (1) answer questions about the physiology, behavior, and ecology of wild animals in situ that would have previously been limited to tests on model organisms in highly controlled settings, (2) study cryptic or wide-ranging animals that have previously evaded investigation, and (3) develop and test entirely new theories. Here we explore how ecologists are using these tools to answer new questions about the physiological performance, energetics, foraging, migration, habitat selection, and sociality of wild animals, as well as collect data on the environments in which they live.},
